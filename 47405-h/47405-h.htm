<h2 class="p4">THE TENOR.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap p2"><span class="smdrop">It was a dim, quiet room</span> in an old-fashioned New
York house, with windows opening upon a garden
that was trim and attractive, even in its Winter dress&mdash;for
the rose-bushes were all bundled up in straw ulsters.
The room was ample, yet it had
a cosy air. Its dark hangings
suggested comfort and luxury,
with no hint of gloom.
A hundred pretty trifles told
that it was a young girl’s
room: in the deep alcove
nestled her dainty white bed,
draped with creamy lace and
ribbons.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-009.jpg" width="250" height="364"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“I was <i>so</i> afraid that
I’d be late!”</p>

<p>The door opened, and two
pretty girls came in, one in hat
and furs, the other in a modest house-dress. The girl in
the furs, who had been afraid that she would be late,
was fair, with a bright color in her cheeks, and an eager,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
intent look in her clear brown eyes. The other girl was
dark-eyed and dark-haired, dreamy, with a soft, warm,
dusky color in her face. They were two very pretty girls
indeed&mdash;or, rather, two girls about to be very pretty,
for neither one was eighteen years old.
The dark girl glanced at a little
porcelain clock.</p>

<p>“You are in time, dear,” she
said, and helped her companion
to take off her wraps.</p>

<p>Then the two girls crossed
the room, and with a caressing
and almost a reverent
touch, the dark girl opened
the doors of a little
carven cabinet that hung
upon the wall, above a
small table covered with
a delicate white cloth.
In its depths, framed in a
mat of odorous double violets, stood the photograph of
the face of a handsome man of forty&mdash;a face crowned
with clustering black locks, from beneath which a pair
of large, mournful eyes looked out with something like
religious fervor in their rapt gaze. It was the face of a
foreigner.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-010.jpg" width="250" height="349"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“O Esther!” cried the other girl, “how beautifully
you have dressed him to-day!”</p>

<p>“I wanted to get more,” Esther said; “but I’ve
spent almost all my allowance&mdash;and violets do cost so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
shockingly. Come, now&mdash;” with another glance at the
clock&mdash;“don’t let’s lose any more time, Louise dear.”</p>

<p>She brought a couple of tiny candles in Sèvres candlesticks,
and two little silver saucers, in which she lit
fragrant pastilles. As the pale gray smoke arose, floating
in faint wreaths and spirals before the enshrined photograph,
Louise sat down and gazed intently upon the little
altar. Esther went to her piano and watched the clock.
It struck two. Her hands fell softly on the keys, and,
studying a printed programme in front of her, she began
to play an overture. After the overture she played one
or two pieces of the regular concert stock. Then she
paused.</p>

<p>“I can’t play the Tschaikowski piece.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the other. “Let us wait for
him in silence.”</p>

<p>The hands of the clock pointed to 2:29. Each girl
drew a quick breath, and then the one at the piano
began to sing softly, almost inaudibly, “les Rameaux”
in a transcription for tenor of Faure’s great song. When
it was ended, she played and sang the <i>encore</i>. Then,
with her fingers touching the keys so softly that they
awakened only an echo-like sound, she ran over the
numbers that intervened between the first tenor solo and
the second. Then she sang again, as softly as before.</p>

<p>The fair-haired girl sat by the little table, gazing intently
on the picture. Her great eyes seemed to devour
it, and yet there was something absent-minded, speculative,
in her steady look. She did not speak until Esther
played the last number on the programme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“He had three encores for that last Saturday,”
she said, and Esther played the three encores.</p>

<p>Then they closed the piano and the little cabinet,
and exchanged an innocent girlish kiss, and Louise went
out, and found her father’s coupé waiting for her, and was
driven away to her great, gloomy, brown-stone home
near Central Park.</p>

<p>Louise Laura Latimer and Esther Van Guilder were
the only children of two families which, though they
were possessed of the three “Rs” which are all and more
than are needed to insure admission to New York society&mdash;Riches,
Respectability and Religion&mdash;yet were not in
Society; or, at least, in the society that calls itself Society.
This was not because Society was not willing to
have them. It was because they thought the world too
worldly. Perhaps this was one reason&mdash;although the
social horizon of the two families had expanded somewhat
as the girls grew up&mdash;why Louise and Esther,
who had been playmates from their nursery days, and
had grown up to be two uncommonly sentimental, fanciful,
enthusiastically morbid girls, were to be found
spending a bright Winter afternoon holding a ceremonial
service of worship before the photograph of a fashionable
French tenor.</p>

<p>It happened to be a French tenor whom they were
worshiping. It might as well have been anybody or any
thing else. They were both at that period of girlish
growth when the young female bosom is torn by a hysterical
craving to worship something&mdash;any thing. They
had been studying music, and they had selected the tenor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
who was the sensation of the hour in New York for their
idol. They had heard him only on the concert stage; they
were never likely to see him nearer. But it was a mere
matter of chance that the idol was not a Boston Transcendentalist,
a Popular Preacher, a Faith-Cure Healer,
or a ringleted old maid with advanced ideas of Woman’s
Mission. The ceremonies might have been different in
form: the worship would have been the same.</p>

<p>M. Hyppolite Rémy was certainly the musical hero
of the hour. When his advance notices first appeared,
the New York critics, who are a singularly unconfiding,
incredulous lot, were inclined to discount his European
reputation.</p>

<p>When they learned that M. Rémy was not only a
great artist, but a man whose character was “wholly
free from that deplorable laxity which is so often a blot
on the proud escutcheon of his noble profession;” that
he had married an American lady; that he had “embraced
the Protestant religion”&mdash;no sect was specified,
possibly to avoid jealousy&mdash;and that his health was
delicate, they were moved to suspect that he might have
to ask that allowances be made for his singing. But
when he arrived, his triumph was complete. He was as
handsome as his pictures, if he <i>was</i> a trifle short, a
shade too stout.</p>

<p>He was a singer of genius, too; with a splendid
voice and a sound method&mdash;on the whole. It was before
the days of the Wagner autocracy, and perhaps his
tremolo passed unchallenged as it could not now; but
he was a great artist. He knew his business as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
his advance-agent knew his. The Rémy Concerts were a
splendid success. Reserved seats, $5. For the Series
of Six, $25.</p>

<p>On the following Monday, Esther Van Guilder returned
her friend’s call, in response to an urgent invitation,
despatched by mail. Louise Latimer’s great bare
room was incapable of transmutation into a cosy nest
of a boudoir. There was too much of its heavy raw silk
furniture&mdash;too much of its vast, sarcophagus-like bed&mdash;too
much of its upholsterer’s elegance, regardless of cost&mdash;and
taste. An enlargement from an ambrotype of the
original Latimer, as he arrived in New York from New
Hampshire, and a photograph of a “child subject” by
Millais, were all her works of art. It was not to be
doubted that they had climbed upstairs from a front
parlor of an earlier stage of social development. The
farm-house was six generations behind Esther; two behind
Louise.</p>

<p>Esther found her friend in a state of almost feverish
excitement. Her eyes shone; the color burned high on
her clear cheeks.</p>

<p>“You never would guess what I’ve done, dear!”
she began, as soon as they were alone in the big room.
“I’m going to see <i>him</i>&mdash;to speak to him&mdash;<i>Esther</i>!”
Her voice was solemnly hushed, “to <i>serve</i> him!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Louise! what <i>do</i> you mean?”</p>

<p>“To serve him&mdash;with my own hands! To&mdash;to&mdash;help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
him on with his coat&mdash;I don’t know&mdash;to do something
that a servant does&mdash;any thing, so that I can say
that once, once only, just for an hour, I have been near
him, been of use to him, served him in one little thing,
as loyally as he serves OUR ART.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Music was THEIR art, and no capitals could tell
how much it was theirs or how much of an art it was.</p>

<p>“Louise,” demanded Esther, with a frightened look,
“are you crazy?”</p>

<p>“No. Read this!” She handed the other girl a
clipping from the advertising columns of a newspaper.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-015b.jpg" width="400" height="62"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“I saw it just by accident, Saturday, after I left
you. Papa had left his paper in the coupé. I was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
up to my First Aid to the Injured Class&mdash;it’s at four
o’clock now, you know. I made up my mind right off&mdash;it
came to me like an inspiration. I just waited until
it came to the place where they showed how to tie up
arteries, and then I slipped out. Lots of the girls slip
out in the horrid parts, you know. And then, instead
of waiting in the ante-room, I put on my wrap, and
pulled the hood over my head and ran off to the
Midlothian&mdash;it’s just around the corner, you know.
And I saw his wife.”</p>

<p>“What was she like?” queried Esther, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Sort of horrid&mdash;actressy.
She had a pink silk wrapper with swansdown all over
it&mdash;at four o’clock, think! I was <i>awfully</i> frightened
when I got there; but it wasn’t the least trouble.
She hardly looked at me, and she engaged me right off.
She just asked me if I was willing to do a whole lot
of things&mdash;I forget what they were&mdash;and where I’d
worked before. I said at Mrs. Barcalow’s.”</p>

<p>“‘Mrs. Barcalow’s?’”</p>

<p>“Why, yes&mdash;my Aunt Amanda, don’t you know&mdash;up
in Framingham. I always have to wash the teacups
when I go there. Aunty says that everybody has
got to do <i>something</i> in <i>her</i> house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Louise!” cried her friend, in shocked admiration;
“how can you think of such things?”</p>

<p>“Well, I did. And she&mdash;his wife, you know&mdash;just
said: ‘Oh, I suppose you’ll do as well as any one&mdash;all
you girls are alike.’”</p>

<p>“But did she really take you for a&mdash;<i>servant</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, indeed. It was raining. I had that old
ulster on, you know. I’m to go at twelve o’clock next
Saturday.”</p>

<p>“But, Louise!” cried Esther, aghast, “you don’t
truly mean to go!”</p>

<p>“I do!” cried Louise, beaming triumphantly.</p>

<p>“<i>Oh, Louise!</i>”</p>

<p>“Now, listen, dear, said Miss Latimer, with the
decision of an enthusiastic young lady with New England
blood in her veins. ‘Don’t say a word till I tell
you what my plan is. I’ve thought it all out, and
you’ve got to help me.’”</p>

<p>Esther shuddered.</p>

<p>“You foolish child!” cried Louise. Her eyes were
sparkling: she was in a state of ecstatic excitement; she
could see no obstacles to the carrying out of her plan.
“You don’t think I mean to <i>stay</i> there, do you? I’m
just going at twelve o’clock, and at four he comes back
from the matinée, and at five o’clock I’m going to
slip on my things and run downstairs, and have you
waiting for me in the coupé, and off we go. Now
do you see?”</p>

<p>It took some time to bring Esther’s less venturesome
spirit up to the point of assisting in this bold undertaking;
but she began, after a while, to feel the delights of
vicarious enterprise, and in the end the two girls, their
cheeks flushed, their eyes shining feverishly, their voices
tremulous with childish eagerness, resolved themselves
into a committee of ways and means; for they were two
well-guarded young women, and to engineer five hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of liberty was difficult to the verge of impossibility.
However, there is a financial man&oelig;uvre known as “kiting
checks,” whereby A exchanges a check with B and
B swaps with A again, playing an imaginary balance
against Time and the Clearing House; and by a similar
scheme, which an acute student of social ethics has called
“kiting calls,” the girls found that they could make Saturday
afternoon their own, without one glance from the
watchful eyes of Esther’s mother or Louise’s aunt&mdash;Louise
had only an aunt to reckon with.</p>

<p>“And, oh, Esther!” cried the bolder of the conspirators,
“I’ve thought of a trunk&mdash;of course I’ve
got to have a trunk, or she would ask me where it was,
and I couldn’t tell her a fib. Don’t you remember the
French maid who died three days after she came here?
Her trunk is up in the store-room still, and I don’t believe
anybody will ever come for it&mdash;it’s been there
seven years now. Let’s go up and look at it.”</p>

<p>The girls romped upstairs to the great unused upper
story, where heaps of household rubbish obscured the
dusty half-windows. In a corner, behind Louise’s baby
chair and an unfashionable hat-rack of the old steering-wheel
pattern, they found the little brown-painted tin
trunk, corded up with clothes-line.</p>

<p>“Louise!” said Esther, hastily, “what did you tell
her your name was?”</p>

<p>“I just said ‘Louise’.”</p>

<p>Esther pointed to the name painted on the trunk,</p>

<p class="pc1 mid"><b>Louise Lévy.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“It is the hand of Providence,” she said. “Somehow,
now, I’m <i>sure</i> you’re quite right to go.”</p>

<p>And neither of these conscientious young ladies reflected
for one minute on the discomfort which might be
occasioned to Madame Rémy by the defection of her new
servant a half-hour before dinner-time on Saturday night.</p>

<p>“Oh, child, it’s you, is it?” was Mme. Rémy’s
greeting at twelve o’clock on Saturday. “Well, you’re
punctual&mdash;and you look clean. Now, are you going to
break my dishes or are you
going to steal my rings?
Well, we’ll find out soon
enough. Your trunk’s
up in your room. Go up
to the servants’ quarters&mdash;right
at the top of
those stairs there. Ask
for the room that belongs
to apartment 11.
You are to room with
their girl.”</p>

<p>Louise was glad of a moment’s respite. She had
taken the plunge; she was determined to go through to
the end. But her heart <i>would</i> beat and her hands
<i>would</i> tremble. She climbed up six flights of winding
stairs, and found herself weak and dizzy when she
reached the top and gazed around her. She was in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
great half-story room, eighty feet square. The most of
it was filled with heaps of old furniture and bedding,
rolls of carpet, of canvas, of oilcloth, and odds and ends
of discarded or unused household gear&mdash;the dust thick
over all. A little space had been left around three sides,
to give access to three rows of cell-like rooms, in each
of which the ceiling sloped from the very door to a tiny
window at the level of the floor. In each room was a
bed, a bureau that served for wash-stand, a small looking-glass,
and one or two trunks. Women’s dresses hung
on the whitewashed walls. She
found No. 11, threw off,
desperately, her hat and
jacket, and sunk down on
the little brown tin trunk,
all trembling from head
to foot.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-020.jpg" width="250" height="305"

</div>

<p>“Hello,” called a
cheery voice. She looked
up and saw a girl in a
dirty calico dress.</p>

<p>“Just come?” inquired
this person, with
agreeable informality. She was
a good-looking large girl, with red hair
and bright cheeks. She leaned against the door-post and
polished her finger-nails with a little brush. Her hands
were shapely.</p>

<p>“Ain’t got onto the stair-climbing racket yet, eh?
You’ll get used to it. ‘Louise Lévy,’” she read the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
on the trunk. “You don’t look like a sheeny. Can’t
tell nothin’ ’bout names, can you? My name’s Slattery.
You’d think I was Irish, wouldn’t you? Well, I’m
straight Ne’ York. I’d be dead before I was Irish. Born
here. Ninth Ward an’ next to an engine-house. How’s
that? There’s white Jews, too. I worked for one, pickin’
sealskins down in Prince Street. Most took the lungs
out of me. But that wasn’t why I shook the biz. It
queered my hands&mdash;see? I’m goin’ to be married in
the Fall to a German gentleman. He ain’t so Dutch
when you know him, though. He’s a grocer. Drivin’
now; but he buys out the boss in the Fall. How’s that?
He’s dead stuck on my hooks, an’ I have to keep ’em
lookin’ good. I come here because the work was light.
I don’t have to work&mdash;only to be doin’ somethin’, see?
Only got five halls and the lamps. You got a fam’ly job,
I s’pose? I wouldn’t have that. I don’t mind the
Sooprintendent; but I’d be dead before I’d be bossed
by a woman, see? Say, what fam’ly did you say you
was with?”</p>

<p>This stream of talk had acted like a nerve-tonic on
Louise. She was able to answer:</p>

<p>“M&mdash;Mr. Rémy.”</p>

<p>“Ramy?&mdash;oh, lord! Got the job with His Tonsils?
Well, you won’t keep it long. They’re meaner ’n
three balls, see? Rent their room up here and chip in
with eleven. Their girls don’t never stay. Well, I got
to step, or the Sooprintendent’ll be borin’ my ear. Well&mdash;so
long!”</p>

<p>But Louise had fled down the stairs. “His Tonsils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>”
rang in her ears. What blasphemy! What sacrilege!
She could scarcely pretend to listen to Mme. Rémy’s
first instructions.</p>

<p>The household <i>was</i> parsimonious. Louise washed
the caterer’s dishes&mdash;he made a reduction in his price.
Thus she learned that a late breakfast took the place of
luncheon. She began to feel what this meant. The beds
had been made; but there was work enough. She helped
Mme. Rémy to sponge a heap of faded finery&mdash;<i>her</i>
dresses. If they had been <i>his</i> coats! Louise bent her
hot face over the tawdry silks and satins, and clasped
her parboiled little finger-tips over the wet sponge. At
half-past three Mme. Rémy broke the silence.</p>

<p>“We must get ready for Musseer,” she said. An
ecstatic joy filled Louise’s being. The hour of her reward
was at hand.</p>

<p>Getting ready for “Musseer” proved to be an appalling
process. First they brewed what Mme. Rémy
called a “teaze Ann.” After the <i>tisane</i>, a host of strange
foreign drugs and cosmetics were marshalled in order.
Then water was set to heat on a gas-stove. Then a
little table was neatly set.</p>

<p>“Musseer has his dinner at half-past four,” Madame
explained. “I don’t take mine till he’s laid down
and I’ve got him off to the concert. There, he’s coming
now. Sometimes he comes home pretty nervous. If
he’s nervous, don’t you go and make a fuss, do you
hear, child?”</p>

<p>The door opened, and Musseer entered, wrapped in
a huge frogged overcoat. There was no doubt that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was nervous. He cast his hat upon the floor, as if he
were Jove dashing a thunderbolt. Fire flashed from his
eyes. He advanced upon his wife
and thrust a newspaper in her face&mdash;a
little pinky sheet, a notorious
blackmailing publication.</p>

<p>“Zees,” he cried, “is your
work!”</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> it, now, Hipleet?”
demanded Mme. Rémy.</p>

<p>“Vot it ees?” shrieked the
tenor. “It ees ze history of how zey
have heest me at Nice! It ees all
zair&mdash;how I have been heest&mdash;in
zis sacré sheet&mdash;in zis hankairchif
of infamy! And it ees you zat have
told it to zat devil of a Rastignac&mdash;<i>traitresse</i>!”</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-023.jpg" width="220" height="290"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“Now, Hipleet,” pleaded his wife, “if I can’t
learn enough French to talk with you, how am I going
to tell Rastignac about your being hissed?”</p>

<p>This reasoning silenced Mr. Rémy for an instant&mdash;an
instant only.</p>

<p>“You <i>vood</i> have done it!” he cried, sticking out
his chin and thrusting his face forward.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t,” said Madame, “and nobody
reads that thing, any way. Now, don’t you mind it, and
let me get your things off, or you’ll be catching cold.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rémy yielded at last to the necessity of self-preservation,
and permitted his wife to remove his
frogged overcoat, and to unwind him from a system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
silk wraps to which the Gordian knot was a slip-noose.
This done, he sat down before the dressing-case, and
Mme. Rémy, after tying a bib around his neck, proceeded
to dress his hair and put brilliantine on his
moustache. Her husband enlivened the operation by
reading from the pinky paper.</p>

<p>“It ees not gen-air-al-lee known&mdash;zat zees dees-tin-guished
tenor vos heest on ze pob-lic staidj at Nice&mdash;in
ze year&mdash;“</p>

<p>Louise leaned against the wall, sick, faint and
frightened, with a strange sense of shame and degradation
at her heart. At last the tenor’s eye fell on her.</p>

<p>“Anozzair eediot?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“She ain’t very bright, Hipleet,” replied his wife;
“but I guess she’ll do. Louise, open the door&mdash;there’s
the caterer.”</p>

<p>Louise placed the dishes upon the table mechanically.
The tenor sat himself at the board, and tucked
a napkin in his neck.</p>

<p>“And how did the Benediction Song go this afternoon?”
inquired his wife.</p>

<p>“Ze Bénédiction? Ah! One <i>encore</i>. One on-lee.
Zese pigs of Américains. I t’row my pairls biffo’ swine.
<i>Chops once more!</i> You vant to mordair me? Vat do
zis mean, madame? You ar-r-r-re in lig wiz my enemies.
All ze vorlt is against ze ar-r-r-teest!”</p>

<p>The storm that followed made the first seem a
zephyr. The tenor exhausted his execratory vocabulary
in French and English. At last, by way of a dramatic
finale, he seized the plate of chops and flung it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
him. He aimed at the wall; but Frenchmen do not
pitch well. With a ring and a crash, plate and chops
went through the broad window-pane. In the moment
of stricken speechlessness that followed, the sound of
the final smash came softly up from the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Ah-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ah!”</p>

<p>The tenor rose to his feet with the howl of an
anguished hyena.</p>

<p>“Oh, good gracious!” cried his wife; “he’s going
to have one of his creezes&mdash;his creezes de nare!”</p>

<p>He did have a <i>crise de nerfs</i>. “Ten dollair!” he
yelled, “for ten dollair of glass!” He tore his pomaded
hair; he tore off his bib and his neck-tie, and for three
minutes without cessation he shrieked wildly and unintelligibly.
It was possible to make out, however, that
“arteest” and “ten dollair” were the themes of his
improvisation. Finally he sank exhausted into the
chair, and his white-faced wife rushed to
his side.</p>

<div class="floatright">

<p>“Louise!” she cried, “get the
foot-tub out of the closet while I
spray his throat, or he can’t sing
a note. Fill it up with warm water&mdash;102
degrees&mdash;there’s the
thermometer&mdash;and bathe his
feet.”</p>

<p>Trembling from head to
foot, Louise obeyed her orders,
and brought the foot-tub, full of steaming water. Then
she knelt down and began to serve the maestro for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
first time. She took off his shoes. Then she looked at
his socks. Could she do it?</p>

<p>“Eediot!” gasped the sufferer, “make haste! I die!”</p>

<p>“Hold your mouth open, dear,” said Madame, “I
haven’t half sprayed you.”</p>

<p>“Ah! <i>you</i>!” cried the tenor. “Cat! Devil! It ees
you zat have killed me!” And moved by an access of
blind rage, he extended his arm, and thrust his wife
violently from him.</p>

<p>Louise rose to her feet, with a hard, set, good old
New England look on her face. She lifted the tub of
water to the level of her breast, and then she inverted it
on the tenor’s head. For one instant she gazed at the
deluge, and at the bath-tub balanced on the maestro’s
skull like a helmet several sizes too large&mdash;then she
fled like the wind.</p>

<p>Once in the servants’ quarters, she snatched her
hat and jacket. From below came mad yells of rage.</p>

<p>“I kill hare! give me my knife&mdash;give me my
rivvolvare! Au secours! Assassin!”</p>

<p>Miss Slattery appeared in the doorway, still polishing
her nails.</p>

<p>“What have you done to His Tonsils?” she inquired.
“He’s pretty hot, this trip.”</p>

<p>“How can I get away from here?” cried Louise.</p>

<p>Miss Slattery pointed to a small door. Louise
rushed down a long stairway&mdash;another&mdash;and yet others&mdash;through
a great room where there was a smell of
cooking and a noise of fires&mdash;past white-capped cooks
and scullions&mdash;through a long stone corridor, and out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
into the street. She cried aloud as she saw Esther’s
face at the window of the coupé.</p>

<p>She drove home&mdash;cured.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi p1"><span class="smdrop">The pleasant smell</span> of freshly turned
garden-mould and of young growing
things came in through the open window
of the Justice of the Peace. His nasturtiums
were spreading, pale and weedy&mdash;I could
distinguish their strange, acrid scent from the
odor of the rest of the young vegetation. The tips of
the morning-glory vines, already up their strings to the
height of a man’s head, curled around the window-frame,
and beckoned to me to come out and rejoice with them
in the freshness of the mild June day. It was pleasant
enough inside the Justice’s front parlor, with its bright
ingrain carpet, its gilt clock, and its marble-topped
centre-table. But the Justice and the five gentlemen
who were paying him a business call&mdash;although it was
Sunday morning&mdash;looked, the whole half dozen of them,
ill in accord with the spirit of the Spring day. The
Justice looked annoyed. The five assembled gentlemen
looked stern.</p>

<p>“Well, as you say,” remarked the fat little Justice,
who was an Irishman, “if this divilment goes on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>&mdash;“</p>

<p>“It’s not a question of going on, Mr. O’Brien,”
broke in Alfred Winthrop; “it has gone on too long.”</p>

<p>Alfred is a little inclined to be arrogant with the
unwinthropian world; and, moreover, he was rushing
the season in a very grand suit of white flannels. He
looked rather too much of a lord of creation for a democratic
community. Antagonism lit the Justice’s eye.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ve got to do it, O’Brien,” I interposed,
hastily. The Justice and I are strong political
allies. He was mollified.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he assented; “let’s have him up and
see what he’s got to say for himself. Mike!” he shouted
out the window; “bring up Colonel Brereton!”</p>

<p>Colonel Brereton had appeared in our village about
a year before that Sunday. Why he came, whence he
came, he never deigned to say. But he made no secret
of the fact that he was an unreconstructed Southron. He
had a little money when he arrived&mdash;enough to buy a
tiny one-story house on the outskirts of the town. By
vocation he was a lawyer, and, somehow or other, he
managed to pick up enough to support him in his avocation,
which, we soon found out, was that of village
drunkard. In this capacity he was a glorious, picturesque
and startling success. Saturated with cheap whiskey, he
sat all day long in the bar-room or on the porch of the
village groggery, discoursing to the neighborhood loafers
of the days befo’ the wah, when he had a vast plantation
in “Firginia”&mdash;“and five hundred niggehs, seh.”</p>

<p>So long as the Colonel’s excesses threatened only
his own liver, no one interfered with him. But on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
night before we called upon the Justice, the Colonel,
having brooded long over his wrongs at the hands of
the Yankees, and having made himself a reservoir of
cocktails, decided to enter his protest against the whole
system of free colored labor by cutting the liver out
of every negro in the town; and he had slightly lacerated
Winthrop’s mulatto coachman before a delegation
of citizens fell upon him, and finding him unwilling to
relinquish his plan, placed him for the night in the
lock-up in Squire O’Brien’s cellar.</p>

<p>We waited for the Colonel. From under our feet
suddenly arose a sound of scuffling and smothered imprecations.
A minute later, Mike, the herculean son of
the Justice, appeared in the doorway, bearing a very
small man hugged to his breast as a baby hugs a doll.</p>

<p>“Let me down, seh!” shouted the Colonel. Mike
set him down, and he marched proudly into the room,
and seated himself with dignity and firmness on the extreme
edge of a chair.</p>

<p>The Colonel was very small indeed for a man of so
much dignity. He could not have been more than five
foot one or two; he was slender&mdash;but his figure was
shapely and supple. He was unquestionably a handsome
man, with fine, thin features and an aquiline profile&mdash;like
a miniature Henry Clay. His hair was snow-white&mdash;prematurely,
no doubt&mdash;and at the first glance you
thought he was clean shaven. Then you saw that there
was scarcely a hair on his cheeks, and that only the finest
imaginable line of snowy white moustaches curled down
his upper lip. His skin was smooth as a baby’s and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the color of old ivory. His teeth, which he was just
then exhibiting in a sardonic smile, were white, small,
even. But if he was small, his carriage was large, and
military. There was something military, too, about his
attire. He wore a high collar, a long blue frock coat,
and tight, light gray trousers with straps. That is, the
coat had once been blue, the trousers once light gray,
but they were now of many tints and tones, and, at
that exact moment, they had here and there certain
peculiar high lights of whitewash.</p>

<p>The Colonel did not wait to be arraigned. Sweeping
his black, piercing eye over our little group, he
arraigned us.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>gentlemen</i>,” with keen irony in his tone,
“I reckon you think you’ve done a right smart thing,
getting the Southern gentleman in a hole? A pro-<i>dee</i>-gious
fine thing, I reckon, since it’s kept you away from
chu’ch. <i>Baptis</i>’ church, I believe?” This was to poor
Canfield, who was suspected of having been of that communion
in his youth, and of being much ashamed of it
after his marriage to an aristocratic Episcopalian. “Nice
Sunday mo’ning to worry a Southern gentleman! Gentleman
who’s owned a plantation that you could stick
this hyeh picayune town into one co’neh of! Owned
mo’ niggehs than you eveh saw. Robbed of his land
and his niggehs by you Yankee gentlemen. Drinks a
little wine to make him fo’get what he’s suffehed. Gets
ovehtaken. Tries to avenge an insult to his honah.
Put him in a felon’s cell and whitewash his gyarments.
And now you come hyeh&mdash;you come hyeh&mdash;” here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
his eye fell with deep disapproval upon Winthrop’s white
flannels&mdash;“you come hyeh in youh underclothes, and
you want to have him held fo’ Special Sessions.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, Colonel Brereton,” Winthrop
interposed; “if we can have your promise&mdash;“</p>

<p>“I will promise you nothing, seh!” thundered the
Colonel, who had a voice like a church-organ, whenever
he chose to use it; “I will make no conventions with
you! I will put no restrictions on my right to defend
my honah. Put me in youh felon’s cell. I will rot in
youh infehnal dungeons; but I will make no conventions
with you. You can put me in striped breeches, but you
cyan’t put my honah in striped breeches!”</p>

<p>“That settles it,” said the justice.</p>

<p>“And all,” continued the Colonel, oratorically,
“and all this hyeh fuss and neglect of youh religious
duties, fo’ one of the cheapest and most o’nery niggehs
I eveh laid eyes on. Why, I wouldn’t have given one
hundred dollahs fo’ that niggeh befo’ the wah. No,
seh, I give you my wo’d, that niggeh ain’t wo’th ninety
dollahs!”</p>

<p>“Mike!” said the Justice, significantly. The Colonel
arose promptly, to insure a voluntary exit. He
bowed low to Winthrop.</p>

<p>“Allow me to hope, seh,” he said, “that you won’t
catch cold.” And with one lofty and comprehensive
salute he marched haughtily back to his dungeon, followed
by the towering Mike.</p>

<p>The Justice sighed. An elective judiciary has its
trials, like the rest of us. It is hard to commit a voter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of your own party for Special Sessions. However&mdash;“I’ll
drive him over to Court in the morning,” said the
little Justice.</p>

<p>I was sitting on my verandah that afternoon, reading.
Hearing my name softly spoken, I looked up and
saw the largest and oldest
negress I had ever met.
She was at least six feet
tall, well-built but not
fat, full black, with
carefully dressed gray
hair. I knew at once
from her neat dress,
her well-trained manner,
the easy deference
of the curtsey
she dropped me, that
she belonged to the
class that used to
be known as “house
darkeys”&mdash;in contradistinction to the field hands.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-036.jpg" width="250" height="303"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“I understand, seh,” she said, in a gentle, low
voice, “that you gentlemen have got Cunnle Bre’eton
jailed?”</p>

<p>She had evidently been brought up among educated
Southerners, for her grammar was good and her pronunciation
correct, according to Southern standards.
Only once or twice did she drop into negro talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>I assented.</p>

<p>“How much will it be, seh, to get him out?” She
produced a fat roll of twenty and fifty dollar bills. “I
do fo’ Cunnle Bre’eton,” she explained: “I have always
done fo’ him. I was his Mammy when he was a baby.”</p>

<p>I made her sit down&mdash;when she did there was
modest deprecation in her attitude&mdash;and I tried to explain
the situation to her.</p>

<p>“You may go surety for Colonel Brereton,” I said;
“but he is certain to repeat the offense.”</p>

<p>“No, seh,” she replied, in her quiet, firm tone;
“the Cunnle won’t make any trouble when I’m here to
do fo’ him.”</p>

<p>“You were one of his slaves?”</p>

<p>“No, seh. Cunnle Bre’eton neveh had any slaves,
seh. His father, Majah Bre’eton, he had slaves one time,
I guess, but when the Cunnle was bo’n, he was playing
kyards fo’ a living, and he had only me. When the Cunnle’s
mother died, Majah Bre’eton he went to Mizzoura,
and he put the baby in my ahms, and he said to me,
‘Sabrine,’ he sez, ‘you do fo’ him.’ And I’ve done fo’
him eveh since. Sometimes he gets away from me, and
then he gets kind o’ wild. He was in Sandusky a year,
and in Chillicothe six months, and he was in Tiffin once,
and one time in a place in the state of Massachusetts&mdash;I
disremembeh the name. This is the longest time he
eveh got away from me. But I always find him, and
then he’s all right.”</p>

<p>“But you have to deal with a violent man.”</p>

<p>“The Cunnle won’t be violent with me, seh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“But you’re getting old, Aunty&mdash;how old?”</p>

<p>“I kind o’ lost count since I was seventy-one, seh.
But I’m right spry, yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, my good woman,” I said, decisively, “I
can’t take the responsibility of letting the Colonel go at
large unless you give me some better guarantee of your
ability to restrain him. What means have you of keeping
him in hand?”</p>

<p>She hesitated a long time, smoothing the folds of
her neat alpaca skirt with her strong hands. Then
she said:</p>

<p>“Well, seh, I wouldn’t have you say any thing
about it, fo’ feah of huhting Cunnle Bre’eton’s feelings;
but when he gets that way, I jes’ nachully tuhn him up
and spank him. I’ve done it eveh since he was a baby,”
she continued, apologetically, “and it’s the only way.
But you won’t say any thing about it, seh? The Cunnle’s
powerful sensitive.”</p>

<p>I wrote a brief note to the Justice. I do not know
what legal formalities he dispensed with; but that afternoon
the Colonel was free. Aunt Sabrine took him
home, and he went to bed for two days while she washed
his clothes. The next week he appeared in a complete
new outfit&mdash;in cut and color the counterpart of its
predecessor.</p>

<p>Here began a new era for the Colonel. He was no
longer the town drunkard. Aunty Sabrine “allowanced”
him&mdash;one cocktail in the “mo’ning:” a “ho’n” at noon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and one at night. On this diet he was a model of
temperance. If occasionally he essayed a drinking bout,
Aunty Sabrine came after him at eve, and led him home.
From my window I sometimes saw the steady big figure
and the wavering little one going home over the crest of
the hill, equally black in their silhouettes against the
sunset sky.</p>

<p>What happened to the Colonel we knew not. No
man saw him for two days. Then he emerged&mdash;with
unruffled dignity. The two always maintained genuine
Southern relations. He called her his damn black
nigger&mdash;and would have killed any man who spoke ill
of her. She treated him with the humble and deferential
familiarity of a “mammy” toward “young mahse.”</p>

<p>For herself, Aunty Sabrine won the hearts of the
town. She was an ideal washerwoman, an able temporary
cook in domestic <i>interregna</i>, a tender and wise
nurse, and a genius at jam and jellies. The Colonel,
too, made money in his line, and put it faithfully into
the common fund.</p>

<p>In March of the next year, I was one of a Reform
Town Committee, elected to oust the usual local ring.
We discharged the inefficient Town Counsel, who had
neglected our interests in a lot of suits brought by swindling
road-contractors. Aunty Sabrine came to me, and
solemnly nominated Colonel Brereton for the post. “He
is sho’ly a fine loyyeh,” she said.</p>

<p>I know not whether it was the Great American
sense of humor, or the Great American sense of fairness,
but we engaged the Colonel, conditionally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a positive, a marvelous, an incredible success,
and he won every suit. Perhaps he did not know
much law; but he was the man of men for country
judges and juries. Nothing like his eloquence had ever
before been heard in the county. He argued, he cajoled,
he threatened, he pleaded, he thundered, he exploded,
he confused, he blazed, he fairly dazzled&mdash;for silence
stunned you when the Colonel ceased to speak, as the
lightning blinds your eyes long after it has vanished.</p>

<p>The Colonel was utterly incapable of seeing any but
his own side of the case. I remember a few of his
remarks concerning Finnegan, the contractor, who was
suing for $31.27 payments withheld.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

</div>

<p>“Fohty yahds!” the Colonel roared:
“fohty yahds! This hyeh man
Finnegan, this hyeh cock-a-doodle-doo,
he goes along this hyeh road,
and he casts his eye oveh this hyeh
excavation, and he comes hyeh and
sweahs it’s fohty yahds good measure.
Does he take a tape measure
and measure it? NO! Does he even
pace it off with those hyeh corkscrew
legs of his that he’s trying to hide
under his chaiah? NO!! He says,
‘I’m Finnegan, and this hyeh’s fohty
yahds,’ and off he sashays up the hill,
wondering wheah Finnegan’s going to
bring up when he’s walked off the topmost peak of
the snow-clad Himalayas of human omniscience! And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
this hyeh man, this hyeh insult to humanity in a papeh
collah, he comes hyeh, to this august tribunal, and he
asks you, gentlemen of the jury, to let him rob you of
the money you have earned in the sweat of youh brows,
to take the bread out of the mouths of the children
whom youh patient and devoted wives have bohne to
you in pain <i>and</i> anguish&mdash;but I say to you, <i>gen</i>&mdash;<i>tel</i>&mdash;<i>men</i>&mdash;(<i>suddenly
exploding</i>) HIS PAPEH COLLAH
SHALL ROAST IN HADES BEFO’ I WILL BE A
PAHTY TO THIS HYEH INFAMY!”</p>

<p>Finnegan was found in hiding in his cellar when his
counsel came to tell him that he could not collect his
$31.27. “Bedad, is <i>that</i> all?” he gasped; “I t’ought
I’d get six mont’s.”</p>

<p>People flocked from miles about to hear the Colonel.
Recalcitrant jurymen were bribed to service by the promise
of a Brereton case on the docket. His performances
were regarded in the light of a free show, and a
verdict in his favor was looked upon as a graceful gratuity.</p>

<p>He made money&mdash;and he gave it meekly to Aunty
Sabrine.</p>

<p>It was the night of the great blizzard; but there
was no sign of cold or wind when I looked out, half-an-hour
after midnight, before closing my front door.
I heard the drip of water from the trees, I saw a faint
mist rising from the melting snow. At the foot of my
lawn I dimly saw the Colonel’s familiar figure marching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
homeward from some political meeting preliminary to
Tuesday’s election. His form was erect, his step steady.
He swung his little cane and whistled as he walked. I
was proud of the Colonel.</p>

</div>

<p>An hour later the storm was upon us. By noon of
Monday, Alfred Winthrop’s house, two hundred yards
away, might as well have been two thousand, so far as
getting to it, or even seeing it, was concerned. Tuesday
morning the snow had stopped, and we looked out over
a still and shining deluge with sparkling fringes above
the blue hollows of its frozen waves. Across it roared an
icy wind, bearing almost invisible diamond dust to fill
irritated eyes and throats. The election was held that
day. The result was to be expected. All the “hard”
citizens were at the polls. Most of the reformers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
stalled in railroad trains. The Reform Ticket failed of
re-election, and Colonel Brereton’s term of office was
practically at an end.</p>

<p>I was outdoors most of the day, and that night,
when I awoke about three o’clock, suddenly and with a
shock, thinking I had heard Aunty Sabrine’s voice crying:
“Cunnle! wheah are you, Cunnle?” my exhausted
brain took it for the echo of a dream. I must have
dozed for an hour before I sprang up with a certainty
in my mind that I had heard her voice in very truth.
Then I hurried on my clothes, and ran to Alfred Winthrop’s.
He looked incredulous; but he got into his
boots like a man. We found Aunty Sabrine, alive but
unconscious, on the crest of the hill. When we had
secured an asylum for her, we searched for the Colonel.
The next day we learned that he had heard the news of
the election and had boarded a snow-clearing train that
was returning to the Junction.</p>

<p>It was a week before Aunty Sabrine recovered.
When I asked her if she was going to look for the Colonel,
she answered with gentle resignation:</p>

<p>“No, seh. I’m ’most too old. I’ll stay hyeh,
wheah he knows wheah to find me. He’ll come afteh
me, sho’.”</p>

<p>Sixteen months passed, and he did not come.
Then, one evening, a Summer walk took me by the little
house. I heard a voice I could not forget.</p>

<p>“Hyeh, you black niggeh, get along with that suppeh,
or I come in theah and cut youh damn haid off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>!”</p>

<p>Looking up, I saw Colonel Brereton, a little the
worse for wear, seated on the snake fence. No ... he
was not seated; he was hitched on by the
crook of his knees, his toes braced against
the inside of the lower rail. His coat-tails
hung in the vacant air.</p>

</div>


<p>He descended, a little stiffly, I
thought, and greeted me cordially,
with affable dignity. His manner
somehow implied that it was <i>I</i> who
had been away.</p>

<p>He insisted on my coming into
his front yard and sitting down on
the bench by the house, while he condescendingly
and courteously inquired after
the health of his old friends and neighbors. I stayed
until supper was announced. The Colonel was always
the soul of hospitality; but on this occasion he did not
ask me to join him. And I reflected, as I went away,
that although he had punctiliously insisted on my sitting
down, the Colonel had remained standing during our
somewhat protracted conversation.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A ROUND-UP.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap p2"><span class="smdrop">When Rhodora Boyd</span>&mdash;Rhodora Pennington that
was&mdash;died in her little house, with no one near
her but one old maid who loved her, the best society
of the little city of Trega Falls indulged in more or less
complacent reminiscence.</p>

<p>Except to Miss Wimple, the old maid, Rhodora had
been of no importance at all in Trega for ten long years,
and yet she had once given Trega society the liveliest
year it had ever known. (I should tell you that Trega
people never mentioned the Falls in connection with
Trega. Trega was too old to admit any indebtedness
to the Falls.)</p>

<p>Rhodora Pennington came to Trega with her invalid
mother as the guest of her uncle, the Commandant at
the Fort&mdash;for Trega was a garrison town. She was a
beautiful girl. I do not mean a pretty girl: there were
pretty girls in Trega&mdash;several of them. She was beautiful
as the Queen of Sheba was beautiful&mdash;grand,
perfect, radiantly tawny of complexion, without a flaw
or a failing in her pulchritude&mdash;almost too fine a being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
for family use, except that she had plenty of hot woman’s
blood in her veins, and was an accomplished, delightful,
impartial flirt.</p>

<p>All the men turned to her with such prompt unanimity
that all the girls of Trega’s best society joined
hands in one grand battle for their prospective altars
and hearths. From the June day when Rhodora came,
to the Ash Wednesday of the next year when her engagement
was announced, there was one grand battle,
a dozen girls with wealth and social position and knowledge
of the ground to help them, all pitted against one
garrison girl, with not so much as a mother to back her&mdash;Mrs.
Pennington being hopelessly and permanently
on the sick-list.</p>

<p>Trega girls who had never thought of doing more
than wait at their leisure for the local young men to
marry them at <i>their</i> leisure now went in for accomplishments
of every sort. They rode, they drove, they danced
new dances, they read Browning and Herbert Spencer,
they sang, they worked hard at archery and lawn-tennis,
they rowed and sailed and fished, and some of the more
desperate even went shooting in the Fall, and in the
Winter played billiards and&mdash;penny ante. Thus did
they, in the language of a somewhat cynical male observer,
back Accomplishments against Beauty.</p>

<p>The Shakspere Club and the Lake Picnic, which
had hitherto divided the year between them, were submerged
in the flood of social entertainments. Balls and
parties followed one another. Trega’s square stone
houses were lit up night after night, and the broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
moss-grown gardens about them were made trim and
presentable, and Chinese lanterns turned them into a
fairy-land for young lovers.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-049.jpg" width="250" height="294"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>It was a great year for Trega!
The city had been dead, commercially,
ever since the New York
Central Railroad had opened up
the great West; but the unprecedented
flow of champagne and
Apollinaris actually started a little
business boom, based on the inferable
wealth of Trega, and two
or three of Trega’s remaining
firms went into bankruptcy because
of the boom. And Rhodora
Pennington did it all.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the end of a sham-fight? You
have been shouting and applauding, and wasting enough
enthusiasm for a foot-ball match. And now it is all
finished, and nothing has been done, and you go home
somewhat ashamed of yourself, and glad only that the
blue-coated participants must feel more ashamed of
themselves; and the smell of the villainous saltpetre,
that waked the Berserker in your heart an hour ago,
is now noisome and disgusting, and makes you cough
and sneeze.</p>

<p>Even so did the girls of Trega’s best society look
each in the face of the other, when Ash Wednesday
ended that nine months of riot, and ask of each other,
“What has it all been about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>True, there were nine girls engaged to be married,
and engagement meant marriage in Trega. Alma Lyle
was engaged to Dexter Townsend, Mary Waite to John
Lang, Winifred Peters to McCullom McIntosh, Ellen
Humphreys to George Lister, Laura Visscher to William
Jans, (Oranje boven!&mdash;Dutch blood stays Dutch,)
Millicent Smith to Milo Smith, her cousin, Olive Cregier
to Aleck Sloan, Aloha Jones, (niece of a Sandwich Islands
missionary,) to Parker Hall, and Rhodora Pennington
to Charley Boyd.</p>

<p>But all of these matches, save the last, would have
been made in the ordinary course of things. The predestination
of propinquity would have settled that. And
even if Ellen Humphreys had married John Lang instead
of George Lister, and George Lister had wedded
Mary Waite&mdash;why, there would have been no great
difference to admire or to deplore. The only union of
the nine which came as a surprise to the community was
the engagement of Rhodora to Charley Boyd. The
beauty of the season had picked up the one crooked
stick in the town&mdash;a dissolute, ne’er-do-well hanger-on
of Trega’s best society, who would never have seen a
dinner-card if he had not been a genius at amateur
theatricals, an artist on the banjo, and a half-bred
Adonis.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-051.jpg" width="250" height="314"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>There the agony ended for the other girls, and there
it began for Rhodora Boyd. In less than a year, Boyd
had deserted her. The Commandant was transferred to
the Pacific Coast. Rhodora moved, with her mother,
bed-ridden now, into a little house in the unfashionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
outskirts of Trega. There she nursed the mother until
the poor bed-ridden old lady died. Rhodora supported
them both by teaching music and French at the Trega
Seminary, down by the Falls. Morning and evening she
went out and back on that weary,
jingling horse-car line. She received
the annual visits that her
friends paid her, inspired by
something between courtesy
and charity, with her old
stately simplicity and
imperturbable calm;
and no one of them
could feel sure that
she was conscious of
their triumph or of
her degradation. And
she kept the best part
of her stately beauty to
the very last. In any other town she would have been
taught what divorce-courts were made for; but Trega
society was Episcopalian, and that communion is healthily
and conservatively monogamous.</p>

<p>And so Rhodora Boyd, that once was Rhodora Pennington,
died in her little house, and her pet old maid
closed her eyes. And there was an end of Rhodora.
Not quite an end, though.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE TWO CHURCHES OF ’QUAWKET.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/ill-063.jpg" width="150" height="167" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smdrop">The Reverend Colton M.
Pursly</span>, of Aquawket,
(commonly pronounced ’Quawket,)
looked out of his study
window over a remarkably
pretty New England prospect,
stroked his thin, grayish side-whiskers,
and sighed deeply.
He was a pale, sober, ill-dressed
Congregationalist minister of
forty-two or three. He had eyes
of willow-pattern blue, a large nose,
and a large mouth, with a smile of forced amiability in
the corners. He <i>was</i> amiable, perfectly amiable and
innocuous&mdash;but that smile sometimes made people with
a strong sense of humor want to kill him. The smile
lingered even while he sighed.</p>

<p>Mr. Pursly’s house was set upon a hill, although
it was a modest abode. From his window he looked
down one of those splendid streets that are the pride
and glory of old towns in New England&mdash;a street fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
yards wide, arched with grand Gothic elms, bordered
with houses of pale yellow and white, some in the homelike,
simple yet dignified colonial style, some with great
Doric porticos at the street end. And above the billowy
green of the tree-tops rose two shapely spires, one to
the right, of granite, one to the left, of sand-stone. It
was the sight of these two spires that made the Reverend
Mr. Pursly sigh.</p>

<p>With a population of four thousand five hundred,
’Quawket had an Episcopal Church, a Roman Catholic
Church, a Presbyterian Church, a Methodist Church, a
Universalist Church, (very small,) a Baptist Church, a
Hall for the “Seventh-Day Baptists,” (used for secular
purposes every day but Saturday,) a Bethel, and&mdash;“The
Two Churches”&mdash;as every one called the First
and Second Congregational Churches. Fifteen years
before, there had been but one Congregational Church,
where a prosperous and contented congregation worshiped
in a plain little old-fashioned red brick church
on a side-street. Then, out of this very prosperity, came
the idea of building a fine new free-stone church on
Main Street. And, when the new church was half-built,
the congregation split on the question of putting a
“rain-box” in the new organ. It is quite unnecessary to
detail how this quarrel over a handful of peas grew into
a church war, with ramifications and interlacements and
entanglements and side-issues and under-currents and
embroilments of all sorts and conditions. In three years
there was a First Congregational Church, in free-stone,
solid, substantial, plain, and a Second Congregational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Church in granite, something gingerbready, but showy
and modish&mdash;for there are fashions in architecture as
there are in millinery, and we cut our houses this way
this year and that way the next. And these two churches
had half a congregation apiece, and a full-sized debt,
and they lived together in a spirit of Christian unity, on
Capulet and Montague terms. The people of the First
Church called the people of the Second Church the
“Sadduceeceders,” because there was no future for them,
and the people of the Second Church called the people
of the First Church the “Pharisee-mes”. And this
went on year after year, through the Winters when the
foxes hugged their holes in the ground within the woods
about ’Quawket, through the Summers when the birds
of the air twittered in their nests in the great elms of
Main Street.</p>

<p>If the First Church had a revival, the Second
Church had a fair. If the pastor of the First Church
exchanged with a distinguished preacher from Philadelphia,
the organist of the Second Church got a celebrated
tenor from Boston and had a service of song. This
system after a time created a class in both churches
known as “the floats,” in contradistinction to the
“pillars.” The floats went from one church to the
other according to the attractions offered. There were,
in the end, more floats than pillars.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Pursly inherited this contest from
his predecessor. He had carried it on for three years.
Finally, being a man of logical and precise mental
processes, he called the head men of his congregation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
together, and told them what in worldly language might
be set down thus:</p>

<p>There was room for one Congregational Church in
’Quawket, and for one only. The flock must be reunited
in the parent fold. To do this a master stroke
was necessary. They must build a Parish House. All
of which was true beyond question&mdash;and yet&mdash;the
church had a debt of $20,000 and a Parish House
would cost $15,000.</p>

<p>And now the Reverend Mr. Pursly was sitting at
his study window, wondering why all the rich men <i>would</i>
join the Episcopal Church. He cast down his eyes, and
saw a rich man coming up his path who could readily
have given $15,000 for a Parish House, and who might
safely be expected to give $1.50, if he were rightly
approached. A shade of bitterness crept over Mr.
Pursly’s professional smile. Then a look of puzzled
wonder took possession of his face. Brother Joash Hitt
was regular in his attendance at church and at prayer-meeting;
but he kept office-hours in his religion, as in
everything else, and never before had he called upon
his pastor.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, the minister was nervously shaking
hands with Brother Joash Hitt.</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to see you, Mr. Hitt,” he stammered,
“very glad&mdash;I’m&mdash;I’m&mdash;“</p>

<p>“S’prised?” suggested Mr. Hitt, grimly.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down?” asked Mr. Pursly.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitt sat down in the darkest corner of the
room, and glared at his embarrassed host. He was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
huge old man, bent, heavily-built, with grizzled dark
hair, black eyes, skin tanned to a mahogany brown,
a heavy square under-jaw, and big leathery dew-laps on
each side of it that looked as hard as the jaw itself.
Brother Joash had been all things in his long life&mdash;sea-captain,
commission merchant, speculator, slave-dealer
even, people said&mdash;and all things to his profit. Of late
years he had turned over his capital in money-lending,
and people said that his great claw-like fingers had
grown crooked with holding the tails of his mortgages.</p>

<p>A silence ensued. The pastor looked up and saw
that Brother Joash had no intention of breaking it.</p>

<p>“Can I do any thing for you, Mr. Hitt?” inquired
Mr. Pursly.</p>

<p>“Ya-as,” said the old man. “Ye kin. I b’leeve
you gin’lly git sump’n’ over ’n’ above your sellery when
you preach a fun’l sermon?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Hitt, it&mdash;yes&mdash;it is customary.”</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>“The usual honorarium is&mdash;h’m&mdash;ten dollars.”</p>

<p>“The&mdash;<i>whut</i>?”</p>

<p>“The&mdash;the fee.”</p>

<p>“Will you write me one for ten dollars?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;” said the minister, nervously;
“I didn’t know that any one had&mdash;had died&mdash;“</p>

<p>“There hain’t no one died, ez I know. It’s <i>my</i>
fun’l sermon I want.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Mr. Hitt, I trust you are not&mdash;that
you won’t&mdash;that&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Life’s a rope of sand, parson&mdash;you’d ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
know that&mdash;nor we don’t none of us know when it’s
goin’ to fetch loost. I’m most ninety now, ’n’ I don’t
cal’late to git no younger.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Pursly, faintly smiling; “when
the time <i>does</i> come&mdash;“</p>

<p>“No, <i>sir</i>!” interrupted Mr. Hitt, with emphasis;
“when the time <i>doos</i> come, I won’t have no use for it.
Th’ ain’t no sense in the way most folks is berrid.
Whut’s th’ use of puttin’ a man into a mahog’ny coffin,
with a silver plate big’s a dishpan, an’ preachin’ a fun’l
sermon over him, an’ costin’ his estate good money,
when he’s only a poor deef, dumb, blind fool corpse,
an’ don’t get no good of it? <i>Naow</i>, I’ve be’n to the
undertaker’s, an’ hed my coffin made under my own
sooperveesion&mdash;good wood, straight grain, no knots&mdash;nuthin’
fancy, but doorable. I’ve hed my tombstun
cut, an’ chose my text to put onto it&mdash;’we brung
nuthin’ into the world, an’ it is certain we can take
nuthin’ out’&mdash;an’ now I want my fun’l sermon, jes’ as
the other folks is goin’ to hear it who don’t pay nuthin’
for it. Kin you hev it ready for me this day week?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Mr. Pursly, weakly.</p>

<p>“I’ll call fer it,” said the old man. “Heern some
talk about a Perrish House, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” began Mr. Pursly, his face lighting up.</p>

<p>“‘Tain’t no sech a bad <i>i</i>dee,” remarked Brother
Joash. “Wal, good day.” And he walked off before the
minister could say any thing more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>One week later, Mr. Pursly again sat in his study,
looking at Brother Joash, who had a second time settled
himself in the dark corner.</p>

<p>It had been a terrible week for Mr. Pursly. He and
his conscience, and his dream of the Parish House, had
been shut up together working over that sermon, and
waging a war of compromises. The casualties in this
war were all on the side of the conscience.</p>

<p>“Read it!” commanded Brother Joash. The minister
grew pale. This was more than he had expected.
He grew pale and then red and then pale again.</p>

<p>“Go ahead!” said Brother Joash.</p>

<p>“Brethren,” began Mr. Pursly, and then he stopped
short. His pulpit voice sounded strange in his little study.</p>

<p>“Go ahead!” said Brother Joash.</p>

<p>“We are gathered together here to-day to pay a
last tribute of respect and affection&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Clk!” There was a sound like the report of a
small pistol. Mr. Pursly looked up. Brother Joash
regarded him with stern intentness.</p>

<p>“&mdash;to one of the oldest and most prominent
citizens of our town, a pillar of our church, and a
monument of the civic virtues of probity, industry and
wisdom, a man in whom we all took pride, and&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Clk!” Mr. Pursly looked up more quickly this
time, and a faint suggestion of an expression just vanishing
from Mr. Hitt’s lips awakened in his unsuspicious
breast a horrible suspicion that Brother Joash had
chuckled.</p>

<p>“&mdash;whose like we shall not soon again see in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
midst. The children on the streets will miss his familiar
face&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Say!” broke in Brother Joash, “how’d it be for
a delegation of child’n to foller the remains, with flowers
or sump’n’? They’d volunteer if you give ’em the hint,
wouldn’t they?”</p>

<p>“It would be&mdash;unusual,” said the minister.</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Mr. Hitt, “only an <i>i</i>dee of
mine. Thought they might like it. Go ahead!”</p>

<p>Mr. Pursly went ahead, haunted by an agonizing
fear of that awful chuckle, if chuckle it was. But he got
along without interruption until he reached a casual and
guarded allusion to the widows and orphans without
whom no funeral oration is complete. Here the metallic
voice of Brother Joash rang out again.</p>

<p>“Say! Ef the widders and orphans send a wreath&mdash;or
a Gates-Ajar&mdash;<i>ef</i> they do, mind ye!&mdash;you’ll hev
it put a-top of the coffin, where folks’ll see it, wun’t ye?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said the Reverend Mr. Pursly, hastily;
“his charities were unostentatious, as was the whole
tenor of his life. In these days of spendthrift extravagance,
our young men may well&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Say!” Brother Joash broke in once more. “Ef
any one wuz to git up right there, an’ say that I wuz the
derndest meanest, miserly, penurious, parsimonious old
hunks in ’Quawket, you wouldn’t let him talk like that,
would ye?”</p>

<p>“Unquestionably not, Mr. Hitt!” said the minister,
in horror.</p>

<p>“Thought not. On’y thet’s whut I heern one o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>’
your deacons say about me the other day. Didn’t know
I heern him, but I did. I thought you wouldn’t allow
no such talk as that. Go ahead!”</p>

<p>“I must ask you, Mr. Hitt,” Mr. Pursly said, perspiring
at every pore, “to refrain from interruptions&mdash;or
I&mdash;I really&mdash;can not continue.”</p>

<p>“All right,” returned Mr. Hitt, with perfect calmness.
“Continner.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pursly continued to the bitter end, with no
further interruption that called for remonstrance. There
were soft inarticulate sounds that seemed to him to come
from Brother Joash’s dark corner. But it might have
been the birds in the <i>Ampelopsis Veitchii</i> that covered
the house.</p>

<p>Brother Joash expressed no opinion, good or ill, of
the address. He paid his ten dollars, in one-dollar bills,
and took his receipt. But as the anxious minister followed
him to the door, he turned suddenly and said:</p>

<p>“You was talkin’ ’bout a Perrish House?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Kin ye keep a secret?”</p>

<p>“I hope so&mdash;yes, certainly, Mr. Hitt.”</p>

<p>“The’ ’ll be one.”</p>

<p>The Summer days had begun to grow chill, and the
great elms of ’Quawket were flecked with patches and
spots of yellow, when, early one morning, the meagre
little charity-boy whose duty
it was to black Mr. Hitt’s
boots every day&mdash;it was a
luxury he allowed himself in
his old age&mdash;rushed, pale
and frightened, into a neighboring
grocery, and cried:</p>

<p>“Mist’ Hitt’s dead!”</p>

<p>“Guess not,” said the
grocer, doubtfully. “Brother
Hitt’s gut th’ Old Nick’s
agency for ’Quawket, ’n’ I ain’t
heerd th’t he’s been discharged
for inattention to dooty.”</p>

<p>“He’s layin’ there smilin’,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Smilin’?” repeated the grocer. “Guess I’d better
go ’n’ see.”</p>

<p>In very truth, Brother Joash lay there in his bed,
dead and cold, with a smile on his hard old lips, the first
he had ever worn. And a most sardonic and discomforting
smile it was.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Pursly read Mr. Hitt’s funeral
address for the second time, in the First Congregational
Church of ’Quawket. Every seat was filled; every ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
was attentive. He stood on the platform, and below
him, supported on decorously covered trestles, stood the
coffin that enclosed all that was mortal of Brother Joash
Hitt. Mr. Pursly read with his face immovably set on
the line of the clock in the middle of the choir-gallery
railing. He did not dare to look down at the sardonic
smile in the coffin below him; he did not dare to let his
eye wander to the dark left-hand corner of the church,
remembering the dark left-hand corner of his own study.
And as he repeated each complimentary, obsequious,
flattering platitude, a hideous, hysterical fear grew
stronger and stronger within him that suddenly he would
be struck dumb by the “clk!” of that mirthless chuckle
that had sounded so much like a pistol-shot. His voice
was hardly audible in the benediction.</p>

<p>The streets of ’Quawket were at their gayest and
brightest when the mourners drove home from the cemetery
at the close of the noontide hour. The mourners
were principally the deacons and elders of the First
Church. The Reverend Mr. Pursly lay back in his seat
with a pleasing yet fatigued consciousness of duty performed
and martyrdom achieved. He was exhausted,
but humbly happy. As they drove along, he looked with
a speculative eye on one or two eligible sites for the
Parish House. His companion in the carriage was Mr.
Uriel Hankinson, Brother Joash’s lawyer, whose entire
character had been aptly summed up by one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fellow-citizens in conferring on him the designation of
“a little Joash for one cent.”</p>

         title="" />
</div>

<p>“Parson,” said Mr. Hankinson, breaking a long
silence, “that was a fust-rate
oration you made.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear you
say so,” replied Mr.
Pursly, his chronic
smile broadening.</p>

<p>“You treated the deceased
right handsome,
considerin’,” went on the
lawyer Hankinson.</p>

<p>“Considering what?”
inquired Mr. Pursly, in
surprise.</p>

<p>“Considerin’&mdash;well, <i>considerin’</i>&mdash;“
replied Mr. Hankinson,
with a wave of his hand.
“You must feel to be reel disapp’inted
’bout the Parish House,
I sh’d s’pose.”</p>

<p>“The Parish House?” repeated the Reverend Mr.
Pursly, with a cold chill at his heart, but with dignity in
his voice. “You may not be aware, Mr. Hankinson,
that I have Mr. Hitt’s promise that we should have a
Parish House. And Mr. Hitt was&mdash;was&mdash;a man of his
word.” This conclusion sounded to his own ears a trifle
lame and impotent.</p>

<p>“Guess you had his promise that there <i>should</i> be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
a Parish House,” corrected the lawyer, with a chuckle
that might have been a faint echo of Brother Joash’s.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;the Second Church gits it. I draw’d his
will. Good day, parson, I’ll ’light here. Air’s kind o’
cold, ain’t it?”</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE LOVE-LETTERS OF SMITH.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap p2"><span class="smdrop">When the little seamstress</span> had climbed to her
room in the story over the top story of the great
brick tenement house in which she lived, she was quite
tired out. If you do not understand what a story over a
top story is, you must remember that there are no
limits to human greed, and hardly any to the height of
tenement houses. When the man who owned that seven-story
tenement found that he could rent another floor,
he found no difficulty in persuading the guardians of
our building laws to let him clap another story on the
roof, like a cabin on the deck of a ship; and in the
southeasterly of the four apartments on this floor the
little seamstress lived. You could just see the top of her
window from the street&mdash;the huge cornice that had
capped the original front, and that served as her window-sill
now, quite hid all the lower part of the story on top
of the top-story.</p>

<p>The little seamstress was scarcely thirty years old,
but she was such an old-fashioned little body in so many
of her looks and ways that I had almost spelled her
sempstress, after the fashion of our grandmothers. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
had been a comely body, too; and would have been still,
if she had not been thin and pale and anxious-eyed.</p>

<p>She was tired out to-night because she had been
working hard all day for a lady who lived far up in the
“New Wards” beyond Harlem River, and after the long
journey home, she had to climb seven flights of tenement-house
stairs. She was too tired, both in body and
in mind, to cook the two little chops she had brought
home. She would save them for breakfast, she thought.
So she made herself a cup of tea on the miniature stove,
and ate a slice of dry bread with it. It was too much
trouble to make toast.</p>

<p>But after dinner she watered her flowers. She was
never too tired for that: and the six pots of geraniums
that caught the south sun on the top of the cornice did
their best to repay her. Then she sat down in her rocking
chair by the window and looked out. Her eyry was
high above all the other buildings, and she could look
across some low roofs opposite, and see the further end
of Tompkins Square, with its sparse Spring green showing
faintly through the dusk. The eternal roar of the
city floated up to her and vaguely troubled her. She
was a country girl, and although she had lived for ten
years in New York, she had never grown used to that
ceaseless murmur. To-night she felt the languor of
the new season as well as the heaviness of physical
exhaustion. She was almost too tired to go to bed.</p>

<p>She thought of the hard day done and the hard day
to be begun after the night spent on the hard little bed.
She thought of the peaceful days in the country, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
she taught school in the Massachusetts village where she
was born. She thought of a hundred small slights that
she had to bear from people better fed than bred. She
thought of the sweet green fields that she rarely saw
nowadays. She thought of the long journey forth and
back that must begin and end her morrow’s work, and
she wondered if her employer would think to offer to pay
her fare. Then she pulled herself together. She must
think of more agreeable things, or she could not sleep.
And as the only agreeable things she had to think about
were her flowers, she looked at the garden on top of
the cornice.</p>

<p>A peculiar gritting noise made her look down, and
she saw a cylindrical object that glittered in the twilight,
advancing in an irregular and uncertain manner toward
her flower-pots. Looking closer, she saw that it was a
pewter beer-mug, which somebody in the next apartment
was pushing with a two-foot rule. On top of the beer-mug
was a piece of paper, and on this paper was written,
in a sprawling, half-formed hand:</p>

<p class="pi6 p1"><i>porter</i><br />
<i>pleas excuse the libberty And</i><br />
<i>drink it</i></p>

<p class="p1">The seamstress started up in terror, and shut the
window. She remembered that there was a man in the
next apartment. She had seen him on the stairs, on
Sundays. He seemed a grave, decent person; but&mdash;he
must be drunk. She sat down on her bed, all a-tremble.
Then she reasoned with herself. The man was drunk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
that was all. He probably would not annoy her further.
And if he did, she had only to retreat to Mrs. Mulvaney’s
apartment in the rear, and Mr. Mulvaney, who was a
highly respectable man and worked in a boiler-shop,
would protect her. So, being a poor woman who had
already had occasion to excuse&mdash;and refuse&mdash;two or
three “libberties” of like sort, she made up her mind to
go to bed like a reasonable seamstress, and she did. She
was rewarded, for when her light was out, she could see
in the moonlight that the two-foot rule appeared again,
with one joint bent back, hitched itself into the mug-handle,
and withdrew the mug.</p>

<p>The next day was a hard one for the little seamstress,
and she hardly thought of the affair of the
night before until the same hour had come around again,
and she sat once more by her window. Then she smiled
at the remembrance. “Poor fellow,” she said in her
charitable heart, “I’ve no doubt he’s <i>awfully</i> ashamed
of it now. Perhaps he was never tipsy before. Perhaps
he didn’t know there was a lone woman in here to be
frightened.”</p>

<p>Just then she heard a gritting sound. She looked
down. The pewter pot was in front of her, and the
two-foot rule was slowly retiring. On the pot was a
piece of paper, and on the paper was:</p>

<p class="pi6 p1"><i>porter</i><br />
<i>good for the helth</i><br />
<i>it makes meet</i></p>

<p class="p1">This time the little seamstress shut her window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
with a bang of indignation. The color rose to her pale
cheeks. She thought that she would go down to see the
janitor at once. Then she remembered the seven flights
of stairs; and she resolved to see the janitor in the
morning. Then she went to bed and saw the mug
drawn back just as it had been drawn back the night
before.</p>

<p>The morning came, but, somehow, the seamstress
did not care to complain to the janitor. She hated to
make trouble&mdash;and the janitor might think&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;well,
if the wretch did it again she would speak
to him herself, and that would settle it.</p>

<p>And so, on the next night, which was a Thursday,
the little seamstress sat down by her window, resolved
to settle the matter. And she had not sat there long,
rocking in the creaking little rocking-chair which she
had brought with her from her old home, when the
pewter pot hove in sight, with a piece of paper on
the top.</p>

<p>This time the legend read:</p>

<p class="pi6 p1"><i>Perhaps you are afrade i will</i><br />
<i>adress you</i><br />
<i>i am not that kind</i></p>

<p class="p1">The seamstress did not quite know whether to
laugh or to cry. But she felt that the time had come
for speech. She leaned out of her window and addressed
the twilight heaven.</p>

<p>“Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;sir&mdash;I&mdash;will you <i>please</i> put your
head out of the window so that I can speak to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>The silence of the other room was undisturbed.
The seamstress drew back, blushing. But before she
could nerve herself for another attack, a piece of paper
appeared on the end of the two-foot rule.</p>

<p class="pi6 p1"><i>when i Say a thing i</i><br />
<i>mene it</i><br />
<i>i have Sed i would not</i><br />
<i>Adress you and i</i><br />
<i>Will not</i></p>

<p class="p1">What was the little seamstress to do? She stood by
the window and thought hard about it. Should she
complain to the janitor? But the creature was perfectly
respectful. No doubt he meant to be kind. He certainly
was kind, to waste these pots of porter on her.
She remembered the last time&mdash;and the first&mdash;that she
had drunk porter. It was at home, when she was a
young girl, after she had had the diphtheria. She
remembered how good it was, and how it had given her
back her strength. And without one thought of what
she was doing, she lifted the pot of porter and took one
little reminiscent sip&mdash;two little reminiscent sips&mdash;and
became aware of her utter fall and defeat. She blushed
now as she had never blushed before, put the pot down,
closed the window, and fled to her bed like a deer to
the woods.</p>

<p>And when the porter arrived the next night, bearing
the simple appeal:</p>

<p class="pi6 p1"><i>Dont be afrade of it</i><br />
<i>drink it all</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">the little seamstress arose and grasped
the pot firmly by the handle, and
poured its contents over the earth
around her largest geranium. She
poured the contents out to the last
drop, and then she dropped the
pot, and ran back and sat on her
bed and cried, with her face hid in
her hands.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-085.jpg" width="200" height="321"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“Now,” she said to herself,
“you’ve done it! And you’re just as
nasty and hard-hearted and suspicious and mean as&mdash;as
pusley!”</p>

<p>And she wept to think of her hardness of heart.
“He will never give me a chance to say I am sorry,” she
thought. And, really, she might have spoken kindly to
the poor man, and told him that she was much obliged
to him, but that he really mustn’t ask her to drink porter
with him.</p>

<p>“But it’s all over and done now,” she said to herself
as she sat at her window on Saturday night. And
then she looked at the cornice, and saw the faithful little
pewter pot traveling slowly toward her.</p>

<p>She was conquered. This act of Christian forbearance
was too much for her kindly spirit. She read the
inscription on the paper:</p>

<p class="pi6 p1"><i>porter is good for Flours</i><br />
<i>but better for Fokes</i></p>

<p class="p1">and she lifted the pot to her lips, which were not half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
so red as her cheeks, and took a good, hearty, grateful
draught.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-086.jpg" width="200" height="267"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>


<p>She sipped in thoughtful silence after this first
plunge, and presently she was surprised to find the bottom
of the pot in full view.</p>

<p>On the table at her side a few
pearl buttons were screwed up
in a bit of white paper. She untwisted
the paper and smoothed
it out, and wrote in a tremulous
hand&mdash;she <i>could</i> write a very
neat hand&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1"><i>Thanks.</i></p>

<p class="p1">This she laid on the top of
the pot, and in a moment the
bent two-foot-rule appeared and
drew the mail-carriage home.
Then she sat still, enjoying the warm
glow of the porter, which seemed to have permeated
her entire being with a heat that was not at all like the
unpleasant and oppressive heat of the atmosphere, an
atmosphere heavy with the Spring damp. A gritting on
the tin aroused her. A piece of paper lay under her eyes.</p>

<div class="narrow">
<p class="pc1"><i>fine groing weather</i></p>
<p class="pr5"><i>Smith</i></p></div>

<p class="pn1">it said.</p>

<p>Now it is unlikely that in the whole round and range
of conversational commonplaces there was one other
greeting that could have induced the seamstress to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
continue the exchange of communications. But this simple
and homely phrase touched her country heart. What
did “<i>groing weather</i>” matter to the toilers in this
waste of brick and mortar? This stranger must be,
like herself, a country-bred soul, longing for the new
green and the upturned brown mould of the country
fields. She took up the paper, and wrote under the
first message:</p>

<p class="pc1"><i>Fine</i></p>

<p class="p1">But that seemed curt; <i>for</i> she added: “<i>for</i>”
what? She did not know. At last in desperation she
put down <i>potatos</i>. The piece of paper was withdrawn
and came back with an addition:</p>

<p class="pc1"><i>Too mist for potatos.</i></p>

<p class="p1">And when the little seamstress had read this, and
grasped the fact that <i>m-i-s-t</i> represented the writer’s
pronunciation of “moist,” she laughed softly to herself.
A man whose mind, at such a time, was seriously bent
upon potatos, was not a man to be feared. She found a
half-sheet of note-paper, and wrote:</p>

<p class="p1"><i>I lived in a small village before I came to New
York, but I am afraid I do not know much about
farming. Are you a farmer?</i></p>

<p class="p1">The answer came:</p>

<p class="pi6">
<i>have ben most Every thing</i><br />
<i>farmed a Spel in Maine</i></p>
<p class="pi12"><i>Smith</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">As she read this, the seamstress heard a church
clock strike nine.</p>

<p>“Bless me, is it so late?” she cried, and she hurriedly
penciled <i>Good Night</i>, thrust the paper out, and
closed the window. But a few minutes later, passing by,
she saw yet another bit of paper on the cornice, fluttering
in the evening breeze. It said only <i>good nite</i>, and
after a moment’s hesitation, the little seamstress took it
in and gave it shelter.</p>

</div>

<p>After this, they were the best of friends. Every
evening the pot appeared, and while the seamstress
drank from it at her window, Mr. Smith drank
from its twin at his; and notes were
exchanged as rapidly as Mr. Smith’s
early education permitted. They
told each other their histories,
and Mr. Smith’s
was one of travel and
variety, which he seemed
to consider quite a matter
of course. He had
followed the sea, he had
farmed, he had been a
logger and a hunter in
the Maine woods. Now
he was foreman of an East
River lumber yard, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
was prospering. In a year or two he would have enough
laid by to go home to Bucksport and buy a share in a
ship-building business. All this dribbled out in the
course of a jerky but variegated correspondence, in
which autobiographic details were mixed with reflections,
moral and philosophical.</p>

<p>A few samples will give an idea of Mr. Smith’s
style:</p>

<p class="pi6 p1"><i>i was one trip to van demens</i><br />
<i>land</i></p>

<p class="p1">To which the seamstress replied:</p>

<p class="pi6 p1"><i>It must have been very interesting.</i></p>

<p class="p1">But Mr. Smith disposed of this subject very briefly:</p>

<p class="pi6 p1"><i>it wornt</i></p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-089.jpg" width="200" height="407"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Further he vouchsafed:</p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><i>i seen a chinese cook in
hong kong could cook flapjacks
like your Mother</i></p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><i>a mishnery that sells Rum
is the menest of Gods crechers</i></p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><i>a bulfite is not what it is
cract up to Be</i></p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><i>the dagos are wussen the brutes</i></p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><i>i am 6 1¾
but my Father was 6 foot 4</i></p>

<p class="p1">The seamstress had taught school one Winter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
she could not refrain from making an attempt to reform
Mr. Smith’s orthography. One evening, in answer to
this communication:</p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><i>i killd a Bare in Maine 600 lbs waight</i></p>

<p class="p1">she wrote:</p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><i>Isn’t it generally spelled Bear?</i></p>

<p class="p1">but she gave up the attempt when he responded:</p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><i>a bare is a mene animle any way you spel him</i></p>

<p class="p1">The Spring wore on, and the Summer came, and
still the evening drink and the evening correspondence
brightened the close of each day for the little seamstress.
And the draught of porter put her to sleep each night,
giving her a calmer rest than she had ever known during
her stay in the noisy city; and it began, moreover, to
make a little “<i>meet</i>” for her. And then the thought
that she was going to have an hour of pleasant companionship
somehow gave her courage to cook and eat
her little dinner, however tired she was. The seamstress’s
cheeks began to blossom with the June roses.</p>

<p>And all this time Mr. Smith kept his vow of silence
unbroken, though the seamstress sometimes tempted him
with little ejaculations and exclamations to which he
might have responded. He was silent and invisible.
Only the smoke of his pipe, and the clink of his mug
as he set it down on the cornice, told her that a living,
material Smith was her correspondent. They never met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
on the stairs, for their hours of coming and going did not
coincide. Once or twice they passed each other in the
street&mdash;but Mr. Smith looked straight ahead of him,
about a foot over her head. The little seamstress thought
he was a very fine-looking man, with his six feet one and
three-quarters and his thick brown beard. Most people
would have called him plain.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-091.jpg" width="250" height="315"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Once she spoke to him. She was coming home
one Summer evening, and a gang of corner-loafers
stopped her and demanded money to buy beer, as is
their custom. Before she had time to be frightened,
Mr. Smith appeared&mdash;whence, she knew
not&mdash;scattered the gang like chaff,
and, collaring two of the human
hyenas, kicked them, with deliberate,
ponderous, alternate kicks,
until they writhed in ineffable
agony. When he let them
crawl away, she turned to him
and thanked him warmly, looking
very pretty now, with the
color in her cheeks. But Mr.
Smith answered no word.
He stared over her head,
grew red in the face, fidgeted
nervously, but held his peace
until his eyes fell on a rotund
Teuton, passing by.</p>

<p>“Say, Dutchy!” he roared.</p>

<p>The German stood aghast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“I ain’t got nothing to write with!” thundered Mr.
Smith, looking him in the eye. And then the man of
his word passed on his way.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-092.jpg" width="220" height="349"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>And so the Summer went on, and the two correspondents
chatted silently from window to window, hid
from sight of all the world below by the friendly cornice.
And they looked out over the roof,
and saw the green of Tompkins
Square grow darker
and dustier as the months
went on.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was given to
Sunday trips into the suburbs,
and he never came
back without a bunch of
daisies or black-eyed Susans
or, later, asters or
golden-rod for the little
seamstress. Sometimes, with
a sagacity rare in his sex, he
brought her a whole plant, with
fresh loam for potting.</p>

<p>He gave her also a reel in a bottle, which, he wrote,
he had “<i>maid</i>” himself, and some coral, and a dried flying-fish,
that was somewhat fearful to look upon, with its
sword-like fins and its hollow eyes. At first, she could
not go to sleep with that flying-fish hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>But he surprised the little seamstress very much
one cool September evening, when he shoved this letter
along the cornice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-093.jpg" width="450" height="598"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

     <img src="images/ill-094a.jpg" width="220" height="300"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The little seamstress gazed at this letter a long time.
Perhaps she was wondering in what Ready Letter-Writer
of the last century Mr. Smith had found
his form. Perhaps she was amazed
at the results of his first attempt at
punctuation. Perhaps she was thinking
of something else, for there were
tears in her eyes and a smile on her
small mouth.</p>

<p>But it must have been a long
time, and Mr. Smith must have
grown nervous, for presently another
communication came along the line
where the top of the cornice was worn
smooth. It read:</p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><i>If not understood will you
mary me</i>
</p>

<p class="p1">The little seamstress seized a piece of paper and
wrote:</p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><i>If I say Yes, will you speak to me?</i></p>

<p class="p1">Then she rose and passed it out to him, leaning out
of the window, and their faces met.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi2 p1"><span class="smdrop">Dr. Tibbitt</span> stood on the porch of Mrs. Pennypepper’s
boarding-house, and looked
up and down the deserted Main Street
of Sagawaug with a contented smile,
the while he buttoned his driving-gloves.
The little doctor had good
cause to be content with himself and with
everything else&mdash;with his growing practice, with his
comfortable boarding-house, with his own good-looks,
with his neat attire, and with the world in general. He
could not but be content with Sagawaug, for there never
was a prettier country town. The Doctor looked across
the street and picked out the very house that he proposed
to buy when the one remaining desire of his soul
was gratified. It was a house with a hip-roof and with a
long garden running down to the river.</p>

<p>There was no one in the house to-day, but there
was no one in any of the houses. Not even a pair of
round bare arms was visible among the clothes that
waved in the August breeze in every back-yard. It was
Circus Day in Sagawaug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The Doctor was climbing into his gig when a yell
startled him. A freckled boy with saucer eyes dashed
around the corner.</p>

<p>“Doctor!” he gasped, “come quick! The circus
got a-fire an’ the trick elephant’s most roasted!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, Johnny,” said the Doctor, reprovingly.</p>

<p>“Hope to die&mdash;Honest Injun&mdash;cross my breast!”
said the boy. The Doctor knew the sacredness of this
juvenile oath.</p>

<p>“Get in here with me,” he said, “and if I find
you’re trying to be funny, I’ll drop you in the river.”</p>

<p>As they drove toward the outskirts of the town,
Johnny told his tale.</p>

<p>“Now,” he began, “the folks was all out of the
tent after the show was over, and one of the circus men,
he went to the oil-barrel in the green wagon with Dan’l
in the Lion’s Den onto the outside of it, an’ he took in a
candle an’ left it there, and fust thing the barrel busted,
an’ he wasn’t hurted a bit, but the trick elephant she
was burned awful, an’ the ring-tailed baboon, he was
so scared he had a fit. Say, did you know baboons
had fits?”</p>

<p>When they reached the circus-grounds, they found
a crowd around a small side-show tent. A strong odor
of burnt leather confirmed Johnny’s story. Dr. Tibbitt
pushed his way through the throng, and gazed upon the
huge beast, lying on her side on the grass, her broad
shoulder charred and quivering. Her bulk expanded
and contracted with spasms of agony, and from time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
time she uttered a moaning sound. On her head was a
structure of red cloth, about the size of a bushel-basket,
apparently intended to look like a British soldier’s
forage-cap. This was secured by a strap that
went under her chin&mdash;if an elephant has a
chin. This scarlet cheese-box every now and
then slipped down over her eye, and the
faithful animal patiently, in all her anguish,
adjusted it with her prehensile trunk.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-099.jpg" width="200" height="270"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>By her side stood her keeper and the
proprietor of the show, a large man with a
dyed moustache, a wrinkled face, and hair
oiled and frizzed. These two bewailed their loss
alternately.</p>

<p>“The boss elephant in the business!” cried the
showman. “Barnum never had no trick elephant like
Zenobia. And them lynes and Dan’l was painted in new
before I took the road this season. Oh, there’s been a
hoodoo on me since I showed ag’inst the Sunday-school
picnic!”</p>

<p>“That there elephant’s been like my own child,”
groaned the keeper, “or my own wife, I may say. I’ve
slep’ alongside of her every night for fourteen damn
years.”</p>

<p>The Doctor had been carefully examining his
patient.</p>

<p>“If there is any analogy&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>“Neuralogy!” snorted the indignant showman;
“‘t ain’t neuralogy, you jay pill-box, she’s <i>cooked</i>!”</p>

<p>“If there is any analogy,” repeated Dr. Tibbitt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
flushing a little, “between her case and that of a human
being, I think I can save your elephant. Get me a
barrel of linseed oil, and drive these people away.”</p>

<p>The Doctor’s orders were obeyed with eager submission.
He took off his coat, and went to work. He
had never doctored an elephant, and the job interested
him. At the end of an hour, Zenobia’s sufferings were
somewhat alleviated. She lay on her side, chained
tightly to the ground, and swaddled in bandages. Her
groans had ceased.</p>

<p>“I’ll call to-morrow at noon,” said the Doctor&mdash;“good
gracious, what’s that?” Zenobia’s trunk was
playing around his waistband.</p>

<p>“She wants to shake hands with you,” her
keeper explained. “She’s a lady, she is, and she
knows you done her good.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not have any thing of the sort,” said
the Doctor, decisively.</p>

<p>When Dr. Tibbitt called at twelve on the morrow,
he found Zenobia’s tent neatly roped in, an amphitheatre
of circus-benches constructed around her, and this
amphitheatre packed with people.</p>

<p>“Got a quarter apiece from them jays,” whispered
the showman, “jest to see you dress them wownds.”
Subsequently the showman relieved his mind to a casual
acquaintance. “He’s got a heart like a gun-flint, that
doctor,” he said; “made me turn out every one of them
jays and give ’em their money back before he’d lay a
hand to Zenobia.”</p>

<p>But if the Doctor suppressed the clinic, neither he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
nor the showman suffered. From dawn till dusk people
came from miles around to stare a quarter’s worth at the
burnt elephant. Once in a while, as a rare treat, the
keeper lifted a corner of her bandages, and revealed the
seared flesh. The show went off in a day or two, leaving
Zenobia to recover at leisure; and as it wandered
westward, it did an increased business simply because it
had had a burnt trick elephant. Such, dear friends, is
the human mind.</p>

<div class="floatright">

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The Doctor fared even better. The fame of his
new case spread far and wide. People seemed to think
that if he could cure an elephant
he could cure any thing. He was
called into consultation in
neighboring towns. Women
in robust health imagined
ailments, so as to send for
him and ask him shuddering
questions about “that
<i>wretched</i> animal.” The trustees
of the orphan-asylum made
him staff-physician&mdash;in this case
the Doctor thought he could trace a connection of ideas,
in which children and a circus were naturally associated.
And the local newspaper called him a <i>savant</i>.</p>

<p>He called every day upon Zenobia, who greeted
him with trumpetings of joyful welcome. She also
desired to shake hands with him, and her keeper had to
sit on her head and hold her trunk to repress the familiarity.
In two weeks she was cured, except for extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and permanent scars, and she waited only for a favorable
opportunity to rejoin the circus.</p>

<p>The Doctor had got his fee in advance.</p>

<p>Upon a sunny afternoon in the last of August,
Dr. Tibbitt jogged slowly toward Sagawaug in his neat
little gig. He had been to Pelion, the next town, to
call upon Miss Minetta Bunker, the young lady whom
he desired to install in the house with the garden running
down to the river. He had found her starting out
for a drive in Tom Matson’s dog-cart. Now, the Doctor
feared no foe, in medicine or in love; but when a young
woman is inscrutable as to the state of her affections,
when the richest young man in the county is devoting
himself to her, and when the young lady’s mother is
backing the rich man, a young country doctor may well
feel perplexed and anxious over his chance of the prize.</p>

<p>The Doctor was so troubled, indeed, that he paid
no heed to a heavy, repeated thud behind him, on the
macadamized road. His gentle little mare heard it,
though, and began to curvet and prance. The Doctor
was pulling her in, and calming her with a “Soo&mdash;Soo&mdash;down,
girl, down!” when he interrupted himself
to shout:</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar! get off me!”</p>

<p>Something like a yard of rubber hose had come in
through the side of the buggy, and was rubbing itself
against his face. He looked around, and the cold sweat
stood out on him as he saw Zenobia, her chain dragging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
from her hind-foot, her red cap a-cock on her head,
trotting along by the side of his vehicle, snorting with
joy, and evidently bent on lavishing her pliant, serpentine,
but leathery caresses upon his person.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-103.jpg" width="250" height="275"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>His fear vanished in a moment. The
animal’s intentions were certainly pacific,
to put it mildly. He reflected that if
he could keep his horse ahead of
her, he could toll her around
the block and back toward
her tent. He had hardly
guessed, as yet, the depth
of the impression which
he had made upon Zenobia’s
heart, which must
have been a large organ,
if the size of her ears was
any indication&mdash;according to
the popular theory.</p>

<p>He was on the very edge of the town, and his road
took him by a house where he had a new and highly
valued patient, the young wife of old Deacon Burgee.
Her malady being of a nature that permitted it, Mrs.
Burgee was in the habit of sitting at her window when
the Doctor made his rounds, and indicating the satisfactory
state of her health by a bow and a smile. On this
occasion she fled from the window with a shriek. Her
mother, a formidable old lady under a red false-front,
came to the window, shrieked likewise, and slammed
down the sash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-104.jpg" width="220" height="241"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The Doctor tolled his elephant around the block
without further misadventure, and they started up the
road toward Zenobia’s tent, Zenobia caressing her benefactor
while shudders of antipathy ran over his frame.
In a few minutes the keeper hove in sight. Zenobia
saw him first, blew a shrill blast on her trumpet, close
to the Doctor’s ear, bolted through a snake fence, lumbered
across a turnip-field, and disappeared in a patch
of woods, leaving the Doctor to quiet his excited horse
and to face the keeper, who advanced
with rage in his eye.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, you
cuss,” he began, “weaning
a man’s elephant’s affections
away from him? You ain’t
got no more morals than a
Turk, you ain’t. That elephant
an’ me has been side-partners
for fourteen years, an’
here you come between us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want your confounded elephant,” roared
the Doctor; “why don’t you keep it chained up?”</p>

<p>“She busted her chain to git after you,” replied
the keeper. “Oh, I seen you two lally-gaggin’ all along
the road. I knowed you wa’n’t no good the first time I
set eyes on yer, a-sayin’ hoodoo words over the poor
dumb beast.”</p>

<p>The Doctor resolved to banish “analogy” from his
vocabulary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, about four o’clock, Dr. Tibbitt
awoke with a troubled mind. He had driven home after
midnight from a late call, and he had had an uneasy
fancy that he saw a great shadowy bulk ambling along
in the mist-hid fields by the roadside. He jumped out
of bed and went to the window. Below him, completely
covering Mrs. Pennypepper’s nasturtium bed, her prehensile
trunk ravaging the early chrysanthemums, stood
Zenobia, swaying to and fro, the dew glistening on her
seamed sides beneath the early morning sunlight. The
Doctor hastily dressed himself and slipped downstairs
and out, to meet this Frankenstein’s-monster of affection.</p>

<p>There was but one thing to do. Zenobia would follow
him wherever he went&mdash;she rushed madly through
Mrs. Pennypepper’s roses to greet him&mdash;and his only
course was to lead her out of the town before people
began to get up, and to detain her in some remote
meadow until he could get her keeper to come for her
and secure her by force or stratagem. He set off by the
least frequented streets, and he experienced a pang of
horror as he remembered that his way led him past the
house of his one professional rival in Sagawaug. Suppose
Dr. Pettengill should be coming home or going out
as he passed!</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-106.jpg" width="200" height="266"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>He did not meet Dr. Pettengill. He did meet
Deacon Burgee, who stared at him with more of rage
than of amazement in his wrinkled countenance. The
Deacon was carrying a large bundle of embroidered linen
and flannel, that must have been tied up in a hurry.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Deacon,” the Doctor hailed him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
with as much ease of manner as he could assume.
“How’s Mrs. Burgee?”</p>

<p>“She’s doin’ fust rate, no thanks to no circus doctors!”
snorted the Deacon. “An’ if you want to know
any thing further concernin’ her
health, you ask Dr. Pettengill.
<i>He</i>’s got more sense than
to go trailin’ around
the streets with a parboiled
elephant behind
him, a-frightening
women-folks
a hull month afore
the’r time.”</p>

<p>“Why, Deacon!”
cried the Doctor,
“what&mdash;what is
it?”</p>

<p>“It’s a boy,”
responded the Deacon,
sternly; “and
it’s God’s own mercy that ’twa’n’t born with a trunk
and a tail.”</p>

<p>The Doctor found a secluded pasture, near the
woods that encircled the town, and there he sat him
down, in the corner of a snake-fence, to wait until some
farmer or market-gardener should pass by, to carry his
message to the keeper. He had another message to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
send, too. He had several cases that must be attended
to at once. Unless he could get away from his pachydermatous
familiar, Pettengill must care for his cases
that morning. It was hard&mdash;but what was he to do?</p>

<p>Zenobia stood by his side, dividing her attention
between the caresses she bestowed on him and the care
she was obliged to take of her red cap, which was not
tightly strapped on, and slipped in various directions at
every movement of her gigantic head. She was unmistakably
happy. From time to time she trumpeted
cheerily. She plucked up tufts of grass, and offered
them to the Doctor. He refused them, and she ate them
herself. Once he took a daisy from her, absent-mindedly,
and she was so greatly pleased that she smashed his hat
in her endeavors to pet him. The Doctor was a kind-hearted
man. He had to admit that Zenobia meant well.
He patted her trunk, and made matters worse. Her
elephantine ecstasy came near being the death of him.</p>

<p>Still the farmer came not, nor the market-gardener.
Dr. Tibbitt began to believe that he had chosen a
meadow that was <i>too</i> secluded. At last two boys appeared.
After they had stared at him and at Zenobia
for half-an-hour, one of them agreed to produce Dr.
Pettengill and Zenobia’s keeper for fifty cents. Dr.
Pettengill was the first to arrive. He refused to come
nearer than the furthest limit of the pasture.</p>

<p>“Hello, Doctor,” he called out, “hear you’ve been
seeing elephants. Want me to take your cases? Guess
I can. Got a half-hour free. Brought some bromide
down for you, if you’d like to try it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>To judge from his face, Zenobia was invisible. But
his presence alarmed that sensitive animal. She crowded
up close to the fence, and every time she flicked her
skin to shake off the flies she endangered
the equilibrium of the Doctor, who was
sitting on the top rail, for dignity’s
sake. He shouted his directions to his
colleague, who shouted back professional
criticisms.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-108.jpg" width="200" height="252"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“Salicylate of soda for that old woman?
What’s the matter with salicylate of cinchonidia?
Don’t want to kill her before you
get out of this swamp, do you?”</p>

<p>Dr. Tibbitt was not a profane man; but at
this moment he could not restrain himself.</p>

<p>“<i>Damn you!</i>” he said, with such vigor that the
elephant gave a convulsive start. The Doctor felt his
seat depart from under him&mdash;he was going&mdash;going
into space for a brief moment, and then he scrambled
up out of the soft mud of the cow-wallow back of
the fence on which he had been sitting. Zenobia had
backed against the fence.</p>

<p>The keeper arrived soon after. He had only
reached the meadow when Zenobia lifted her trunk in
the air, emitted a mirthful toot, and struck out for the
woods with the picturesque and cumbersome gallop of a
mastodon pup.</p>

<p>“Dern <i>you</i>,” said the keeper to Dr. Tibbitt, who
was trying to fasten his collar, which had broken loose
in his fall; “if the boys was here, and I hollered ‘Hey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Rube!’&mdash;there wouldn’t be enough left of yer to
spread a plaster fer a baby’s bile!”</p>

<p>The Doctor made himself look as decent as the
situation allowed, and then he marched toward the
town with the light of a firm resolve illuminating his
face. The literature of his childhood had come to his
aid. He remembered the unkind tailor who pricked the
elephant’s trunk. It seemed to him that the tailor was
a rather good fellow.</p>

<p>“If that elephant’s disease is gratitude,” thought
the Doctor, “I’ll give her an antidote.”</p>

<p>He went to the drug-store, and, as he went, he
pulled out a blank pad and wrote down a prescription,
from mere force of habit. It read thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-109.jpg" width="400" height="343"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>When the druggist looked at it, he was taken short
of breath.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” he asked&mdash;“a bombshell?”</p>

<p>“Put it up,” said the Doctor, “and don’t talk so
much.” He lingered nervously on the druggist’s steps,
looking up and down the street. He had sent a boy to
order the stable-man to harness his gig. By-and-by,
the druggist put his head out of the door.</p>

<p>“I’ve got some asaf&oelig;tida pills,” he said, “that
are kind o’ tired, and half a pound of whale-oil soap
that’s higher’n Haman&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Put ’em in!” said the Doctor, grimly, as he saw
Zenobia coming in sight far down the street.</p>

<p>She came up while the Doctor was waiting
for the bolus. Twenty-three boys were
watching them, although it was only
seven o’clock in the morning.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-110.jpg" width="250" height="293"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“Down, Zenobia!” said the
Doctor, thoughtlessly, as he
might have addressed a dog.
He was talking with the druggist,
and Zenobia was patting his
ear with her trunk. Zenobia sank
to her knees. The Doctor did not
notice her. She folded her trunk about
him, lifted him to her back, rose, with a
heave and a sway, to her feet, and started up the road.
The boys cheered. The Doctor got off on the end of
an elm-branch. His descent was watched from nineteen
second-story windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>His gig came to meet him at last, and he entered
it and drove rapidly out of town, with Zenobia trotting
contentedly behind him. As soon as he had passed
Deacon Burgee’s house, he drew rein, and Zenobia
approached, while his perspiring mare stood on her
hind-legs.</p>

<p>“Zenobia&mdash;pill!” said the Doctor.</p>

<p>As she had often done in her late illness, Zenobia
opened her mouth at the word of command, and swallowed
the infernal bolus. Then they started up again,
and the Doctor headed for Zenobia’s tent.</p>

<p>But Zenobia’s pace was sluggish. She had been
dodging about the woods for two nights, and she was
tired. When the Doctor whipped up, she seized the
buggy by any convenient projection, and held it back.
This damaged the buggy and frightened the horse; but
it accomplished Zenobia’s end. It was eleven o’clock
before Jake Bumgardner’s “Half-Way-House” loomed
up white, afar down the dusty road, and the Doctor
knew that his round-about way had at length brought
him near to the field where the circus-tent had been
pitched.</p>

<p>He drove on with a lighter heart in his bosom. He
had not heard Zenobia behind him, for some time. He
did not know what had become of her, or what she was
doing, but he learned later.</p>

<p>The Doctor had compounded a pill well calculated
to upset Zenobia’s stomach. That it would likewise give
her a consuming thirst he had not considered. But
chemistry was doing its duty without regard to him. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
thirst like a furnace burned within Zenobia. Capsicum
and chloride of lime were doing their work. She gasped
and groaned. She searched for water. She filled her
trunk at a wayside trough and poured the contents into
her mouth. Then she sucked up a puddle or two.
Then she came to Bumgardner’s, where a dozen kegs
of lager-beer and a keg of what passed at Bumgardner’s
for gin stood on the sidewalk. Zenobia’s circus experience
had taught her what a water-barrel meant. She
applied her knowledge. With her forefoot she deftly
staved in the head of one keg after another, and with
her trunk she drew up the beer and the gin, and delivered
them to her stomach. If you think her taste at fault,
remember the bolus.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-112.jpg" width="400" height="238"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Bumgardner rushed out and assailed her with a
bung-starter. She turned upon him and squirted lager-beer
over him until he was covered with an iridescent
lather of foam from head to foot. Then she finished the
kegs and went on her way, to overtake the Doctor.</p>

<p>The Doctor was speeding his mare merrily along,
grateful for even a momentary relief from Zenobia’s
attentions, when, at one and the same time, he heard a
heavy, uncertain thumping on the road behind him, and
the quick patter of a trotter’s hoofs on the road ahead
of him. He glanced behind him first, and saw Zenobia.
She swayed from side to side, more than was her wont.
Her red cap was far down over her left eye. Her aspect
was rakish, and her gait was unsteady. The Doctor
did not know it, but Zenobia was drunk.</p>

<p>Zenobia was sick, but intoxication
dominated her sickness. Even
sulphide of calcium withdrew courteously
before the might of beer
and gin. Rocking from side to
side, reeling across the road
and back, trumpeting in
imbecile inexpressive tones,
Zenobia advanced.</p>

<div class="floatright">

</div>

<p>The Doctor looked
forward. Tom Matson sat in
his dog-cart, with Miss Bunker by
his side. His horse had caught sight of Zenobia, and
he was rearing high in air, and whinnying in terror.
Before Tom could pull him down, he made a sudden
break, overturned the dog-cart, and flung Tom and Miss
Minetta Bunker on a bank by the side of the road. It
was a soft bank, well-grown with mint and stinging-nettles,
just above a creek. Tom had scarce landed before
he was up and off, running hard across the fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Minetta rose and looked at him with fire in
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Well!” she said aloud; “I’d like Mother to see
you <i>now</i>!”</p>

<p>The Doctor had jumped out of his gig and let his
little mare go galloping up the road. He had his arm
about Miss Minetta’s waist when he turned to face his
familiar demon&mdash;which may have accounted for the
pluck in his face.</p>

<p>But Zenobia was a hundred yards down the road,
and she was utterly incapable of getting any further.
She trumpeted once or twice, then she wavered like a
reed in the wind; her legs weakened under her, and she
sank on her side. Her red cap had slipped down, and
she picked it up with her trunk, broke its band in a
reckless swing that resembled the wave of jovial farewell,
gave one titanic hiccup, and fell asleep by the roadside.</p>

<p>An hour later, Dr. Tibbitt was driving toward
Pelion, with Miss Bunker by his side. His horse had
been stopped at the toll-gate. He was driving with one
hand. Perhaps he needed the other to show how they
could have a summer-house in the garden that ran
down to the river.</p>

<p>But it was evening when Zenobia awoke to find her
keeper sitting on her head. He jabbed a cotton-hook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
firmly and decisively into her ear, and led her homeward
down the road lit by the golden sunset. That was
the end of Zenobia’s infidelity.</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2"><span class="smdrop">Miss Bessie Vaux</span>, of Baltimore, paid a visit to her
aunt, the wife of the Commandant at old Fort
Starbuck, Montana. She had at her small feet all the
garrison and some two dozen young
ranch-owners, the flower of the
younger sons of the best society
of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.
Thirty-seven notches in
the long handle of her parasol
told the story of her three months’

She accepted a measly Second-Lieutenant,
and left all the bachelors
for thirty miles around the Fort to mourn her and to
curse the United States Army. This is the proem.</p>

<p>Mr. John Winfield, proprietor of the Winfield
Ranch, sat a-straddle a chair in front of the fire in his
big living room, and tugged at his handsome black
beard as he discussed the situation with his foreman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
who was also his confidant, his best friend and his old
college mate. Mr. Richard Cutter stood with his back
to the fire, twirled a very blonde moustache and smoked
cigarettes continually while he ministered to his suffering
friend, who was sore wounded in his vanity, having been
notch No. 36 on Miss Vaux’s parasol. Dick had been
notch No. 1; but Dick was used to that sort of thing.</p>

<p>“By thunder,” said Mr. Winfield, “I’m going to
get married this year, if I have to marry a widow with
six children. And I guess I’ll have to. I’ve been ten
years in this girlless wilderness, and I never did know
any girls to speak of, at home. Now <i>you</i>, you always
everlastingly knew girls. What’s that place you lived at
in New York State&mdash;where there were so many girls?”</p>

<p>“Tusculum,” replied Mr. Cutter, in a tone of complacent
reminiscence. “Nice old town, plastered so thick
with mortgages that you can’t grow flowers in the front
yard. All the fellows strike for New York as soon as they
begin to shave. The crop of girls remains, and they
wither on the stem. Why, one Winter they had a hump-backed
man for their sole society star in the male line.
Nice girls, too. Old families. Pretty, lots of them. Good
form, too, for provincials.”</p>

<p>“Gad!” said Jack Winfield, “I’d like to live in
Tusculum for a year or so.”</p>

<p>“No, you wouldn’t. It’s powerful dull. But the
girls were nice. Now, there were the Nine Cent-Girls.”</p>

<p>“The Nine-cent Girls?”</p>

<p>“No, the Nine Cent-Girls. Catch the difference?
They were the daughters of old Bailey, the civil engineer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Nine of ’em, ranging from twenty-two, when I was there&mdash;that’s
ten years ago&mdash;down to&mdash;oh, I don’t know&mdash;a
kid in a pinafore. All looked just alike, barring
age, and every one had the face of the Indian lady on
the little red cent. Do you remember the Indian lady
on the little red cent?”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” suggested Jack, rising; “I’ve got one.
I’ve had it ever since I came.” He unlocked his desk,
rummaged about in its depths, and produced a specimen
of the neatest and most artistic coin that the United
States government has ever struck.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said Dick, holding the coppery disk
in his palm. “It would do for a picture of any one
of ’em&mdash;only the Bailey girls didn’t wear feathers in
their hair. But there they were, nine of ’em, nice girls,
every way, and the whole lot named out of the classics.
Old Bailey was strong on the classics. His great-grandfather
named Tusculum, and Bailey’s own name was
M. Cicero Bailey. So he called all his girls by heathen
names, and had a row with the parson every christening.
Let me see&mdash;there was Euphrosyne, and Clelia, and
Lydia, and Flora and Aurora&mdash;those were the twins&mdash;I
was sweet on one of the twins&mdash;and Una&mdash;and,
oh, I can’t remember them all. But they were mighty
nice girls.”</p>

<p>“Probably all married by this time,” Jack groaned.
“Let me look at that cent.” He held it in the light of
the fire, and gazed thoughtfully upon it.</p>

<p>“Not a one,” Dick assured him. “I met a chap
from Tusculum last time I was in Butte City, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
asked him. He said there’d been only one wedding in
Tusculum in three years, and then the local paper had
a wire into the church and got out extras.”</p>

<p>“What sort of girls were they?” Winfield asked,
still regarding the coin.</p>

<p>“Just about like that, for looks. Let me see it
again.” Dick examined the cent critically, and slipped
it into his pocket, in an absent-minded way. “Just
about like that. First rate girls. Old man was as poor
as a church mouse; but you would never have known it,
the way that house was run. Bright girls, too&mdash;at
least, my twin was. I’ve forgotten which twin it was;
but she was too bright for me.”</p>

<p>“And how old did you say they were? How old
was the youngest?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” replied Dick, with a bachelor’s
vagueness on the question of a child’s age, “five&mdash;six&mdash;seven,
may be. Ten years ago, you know.”</p>

<p>“Just coming in to grass,” observed Mr. Winfield,
meditatively.</p>

<p>Two months after the evening on which this conversation
took place, Mr. Richard Cutter walked up one
of the quietest and most eminently respectable of the
streets of Tusculum.</p>

<p>Mr. Cutter was nervous. He was, for the second
time, making up his mind to attempt a difficult and
delicate task. He had made up his mind to it, or had
had it made up for him; but now he felt himself obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to go over the whole process in his memory, in order to
assure himself that the mind was really made up.</p>

<p>The suggestion had come from Winfield. He remembered
with what a dazed incomprehension he had
heard his chum’s proposition to induce Mr. Bailey and
all his family to migrate to Montana and settle at
Starbuck.</p>

<p>“We’ll give the old man all the surveying he
wants. And he can have Ashford’s place on the big
dam when Ashford goes East in August. Why, the finger
of Providence is pointing Bailey straight for Starbuck.”</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-123.jpg" width="220" height="179"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>With a clearer remembrance of Eastern conventionalities
than Mr. Winfield, Dick Cutter had suggested
various obstacles in the way of this apparently simple
scheme. But Winfield would hear of no opposition,
and he joined with him eight other young
ranchmen, who entered into the idea with
wild Western enthusiasm and an Arcadian
simplicity that could see
no chance of failure. These
energetic youths subscribed a
generous fund to defray the expenses
of Mr. Cutter as a missionary
to Tusculum; and Mr. Cutter had found himself committed
to the venture before he knew it.</p>

<p>Now, what had seemed quite feasible in Starbuck’s
wilds wore a different face in prim and proper Tusculum.
It dawned on Mr. Cutter that he was about to
make a most radical and somewhat impudent proposition
to a conservative old gentleman. The atmosphere of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Tusculum weighed heavy on its spirits, which were light
and careless enough in his adopted home in Montana.</p>

<p>Therefore Mr. Cutter found his voice very uncertain
as he introduced himself to the young lady who opened,
at his ring, the front door of one of the most respectable
houses in that respectable street of Tusculum.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” he said, wondering which one
of the Nine Cent-Girls he saw before him; and then,
noting a few threads of gray in her hair, he ventured:</p>

<p>“It’s Miss&mdash;Miss Euphrosyne, isn’t it? You
don’t remember me&mdash;Mr. Cutter, Dick Cutter? Used
to live on Ovid Street. Can I see your father?”</p>

<p>“My father?” repeated Miss Euphrosyne, looking
a little frightened.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I just want&mdash;“</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-124.jpg" width="220" height="221"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“Why, Mr. Cutter&mdash;I do
remember you now&mdash;didn’t
you know that Papa died nine
years ago&mdash;the year after you
left Tusculum?”</p>

<p>Dick Cutter leaned against the door-jamb
and stared speechlessly at Euphrosyne.
He noted vaguely that she looked
much the same as when he had last seen her, except
that she looked tired and just a shade sad. When he
was able to think, he said that he begged her pardon.
Then she smiled, faintly.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t expect you to know,” she said,
simply. “Won’t you come in?”</p>

<p>“N-N-No,” stuttered Dick. “I-I-I’ll call later&mdash;this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
evening, if you don’t mind. Ah&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>good</i> day.”
And he fled to his hotel, to pull himself together, leaving
Miss Euphrosyne smiling.</p>

<p>He sat alone in his room all the afternoon, pondering
over the shipwreck of his scheme. What should he
tell the boys? What would the boys say? Why had
he not thought to write before he came? Why on earth
had Bailey taken it into his head to die?</p>

<p>After supper, he resolved to call as he had promised.
Mrs. Bailey, he knew, had died a year after the
appearance of her ninth daughter. But, he thought,
with reviving hope, there might be a male head to the
family&mdash;an uncle, perhaps.</p>

<p>The door was opened by Clytie, the youngest of the
nine. She ushered him at once into a bright little
parlor, hung around with dainty things in artistic needlework
and decorative painting. A big lamp glowed on a
centre-table, and around it sat seven of the sisters, each
one engaged in some sort of work,
sewing, embroidering or designing.
Nearest, the lamp
sat Euphrosyne, reading
Macaulay aloud. She stopped
as he entered, and welcomed
him in a half-timid
but wholly friendly fashion.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-125.jpg" width="250" height="121"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Dick sat down, very much embarrassed, in spite
of the greeting. It was many years since he had talked
to nine ladies at once. And, in truth, a much less embarrassed
man might have found himself more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
troubled to carry on a conversation with nine young
women who looked exactly like each other, except for the
delicate distinctions of age which a masculine stranger
might well be afraid to note. Dick looked from one to
the other of the placid classic faces, and could not help
having an uneasy idea that each new girl that he addressed
was only the last one who had slipped around
the table and made herself look a year or two older or
younger.</p>

<p>But after a while the pleasant, genial, social atmosphere
of the room, sweet with a delicate, winning virginity,
thawed out his awkward reserve, and Dick began
to talk of the West and Western life until the nine pairs
of blue eyes, stretched to their widest, fixed upon him as
a common focus. It was eleven when he left, with many
apologies for his long call. He found the night and the
street uncommonly dark, empty and depressing.</p>

<p>“Just the outfit!” he observed to himself. “And
old Bailey dead and the whole scheme busted.”</p>

<p>For he had learned that the Nine Cent-Girls had
not a relative in the world. Under these circumstances,
it was clearly his duty to take the morning train for the
West. And yet, the next evening, he presented himself,
shamefaced and apologetic, at the Bailey’s door.</p>

<p>He thought that he wanted to make some sort of
explanation to Miss Euphrosyne. But what explanation
could he make? There was no earthly reason for his
appearance in Tusculum. He talked of the West until
eleven o’clock, and then he took a hesitating leave.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-127.jpg" width="220" height="188"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The next day he made a weak pretense of casually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
passing by when he knew that Miss Euphrosyne was
working in the garden; but he found it no easier to
explain across the front fence.
The explanation never would
have been made if it had not
been for Miss Euphrosyne.
A curious nervousness had
come over her, too, and suddenly
she spoke out.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cutter&mdash;excuse
me&mdash;but what has brought
you here? I mean is it any
thing that concerns us&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;Papa’s
affairs! I thought everything was settled&mdash;I had hoped&mdash;“</p>

<p>There was nothing for it now but to tell the whole
story, and Dick told it.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll think we’re a pack of barbarians,”
he said, when he had come to the end, “and, of
course, it’s all impracticable <i>now</i>.”</p>

<p>But Miss Euphrosyne did not seem to be offended&mdash;only
thoughtful.</p>

<p>“Can you call here to-morrow at this time, Mr.
Cutter?” she inquired.</p>

<p>Miss Euphrosyne blushed faintly when Dick presented
himself to hear judgement pronounced.</p>

<p>“I suppose you will think it strange,” she said,
“but if your plan is feasible, I should wish to carry it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
out. Frankly, I <i>do</i> want to see the girls married. Clelia
and Lydia and I are past the time when women think
about such things&mdash;but Clytie&mdash;and the rest. And,
you know, I can remember how Papa and Mama lived
together, and sometimes it seems cruelly hard that those
dear girls should lose all that happiness&mdash;I’m sure it’s
the best happiness in the world. And it can never be,
<i>here</i>. Now, if I could get occupation&mdash;you know that
I’m teaching school, I suppose&mdash;and if the rest of the
girls could keep up their work for the New York people&mdash;why&mdash;don’t
you know, if I didn’t tell&mdash;if I put it
on business grounds, you know&mdash;I think they would feel
that it was best, after all, to leave Tusculum....”</p>

<p>Her voice was choked when she recommenced.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-128.jpg" width="200" height="141"
         alt=""

</div>

<p>“It seems awful for me to talk to you in this cold-blooded
way about such a thing; but&mdash;what <i>can</i> we do,
Mr. Cutter? You don’t know how poor we are. There’s
nothing for my little Clytie to do but to be a dressmaker&mdash;and
you know what <i>that</i> means, in
Tusculum. Oh, <i>do</i> you think I could
teach school out in Star&mdash;Star&mdash;Starbuckle?”</p>

<p>Miss Euphrosyne was crying.</p>

<p>Dick’s census of possible pupils
in the neighborhood of
Starbuck satisfied Miss Euphrosyne.
It troubled Dick’s conscience a bit, as he walked back to
the hotel. “But they’ll all be married off before she
finds it out, so I guess it’s all right,” he reflected.</p>

<p>The next week Dick went to New York. This was
in pursuance of an idea which he had confided to Winfield,
on the eve of his forth-setting.</p>

<p>“Why,” Winfield had said to him, “you are clean
left out of this deal, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am,” said Dick. “How am I going
to marry a poor girl on a hundred dollars a month?”</p>

<p>“I might set you up for yourself&mdash;” began his
employer.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” broke in Dick Cutter, with emphasis.
“You wouldn’t talk that way if you’d ever been hungry
yourself. I ’most starved that last time I tried for myself;
and I’d starve next trip, sure. You’ve been a good
friend to me, Jack Winfield. Don’t you make a damn
fool of yourself and spoil it all.”</p>

<p>“But,” he added, after a pause, “I <i>have</i> a little
racket of my own. There’s a widow in New York who
smiled on yours affectionately once, ere she wed Mammon.
I’m going just to see if she feels inclined to divide
the late lamented’s pile with a blonde husband.”</p>

<p>So, the business at Tusculum being determined, and
preparations for the hegira well under way, Dick went to
look after his own speculation.</p>

<p>He reached New York on Tuesday morning, and
called on the lady of his hopes that afternoon. She was
out. He wrote to her in the evening, asking when he
might see her. On Thursday her wedding-cards came
to his hotel by special messenger. He cursed his luck,
and went cheerfully about attending to a commission
which Miss Euphrosyne, after much urging, had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
him, trembling at her own audacity. The size of it had
somewhat staggered him. She asked him to take an
order to a certain large dry-goods house for nine traveling
ulsters, (ladies’, medium weight, measurements enclosed,)
for which he was to select the materials.</p>

<p>“Men have so much taste,” said Miss Euphrosyne.
“Papa <i>always</i> knew when we were well dressed.”</p>

<p>Dick had to wait while another customer was served.
He stared at her in humble admiration. It was a British
actress, recently imported.</p>

<p>When Mr. Richard Cutter sat on the platform of
Tusculum station and saw his nine charges approach,
ready for the long trip to the Far West, it struck him that
the pinky-dun ulsters with the six-inch-square checks of
pale red and blue did not look, on these nine virgins, as
they looked on the British actress. It struck him, moreover,
that the nine “fore-and-aft,” or “deer-stalker”
caps which he had thrown in as Friendship’s Offering
only served to more accentuate a costume already accentuated.</p>

<p>But it was too late for retreat. The Baileys had
burned their bridges behind them. The old house was
sold. Their lot was cast in Montana. He had his misgivings;
but he handed them gallantly into the train&mdash;it
was not a vestibule express, for economy forbade&mdash;and
they began their journey.</p>

<p>He had an uneasy feeling that they were noticed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
that the nine ladies in the ulsters of one pattern&mdash;and
of the pattern of his choosing&mdash;were attracting more
attention than any ladies not thus uniformed would have
attracted; but he was not seriously disturbed until a
loquacious countryman sat down beside him.</p>

<p>“Runnin’ a lady base-ball nine, be ye?”
he inquired. “I seen one, wunst, down
to Ne’ York. They can’t play ball not
to speak of; but it’s kinder fun lookin’
at ’em. Couldn’t ye interdooce me to
the pitcher?”</p>

</div>
<p>Mr. Cutter made a dignified reply,
and withdrew to the smoking-car. There a
fat and affable stranger tapped him on the back and
talked in his ear from the seat behind.</p>

<p>“It don’t pay, young man,” he said. “I’ve handled
’em. Female minstrels sounds first rate; but they don’t
give the show that catches the people. You’ve gotter
have reel talent kinder mixed in with them if you want
to draw.”</p>

<p>“Them ladies in your comp’ny, where do they
show?” inquired the Conductor, as he examined the ten
tickets that Dick presented.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked the irritated pioneer.</p>

<p>“If they show in Cleveland, I’d like to go, first
rate,” the Conductor explained.</p>

<p>“Those ladies,” Dick thundered, at the end of his
patience, “are not actresses!”</p>

<p>“Hmf! What be they then?” asked the Conductor.</p>

<p>They had arrived at Buffalo. They had gone to
the Niagara Hotel, and had been told that there were no
rooms for them; and to the Tifft House, where there
were no rooms; and to the Genesee, where every room
was occupied. Finally they had found quarters in a
very queer hotel, where the clerk, as he dealt out the
keys, said:</p>

<p>“One for Lily, and one for Daisy and one for Rosie&mdash;here,
Boss, sort out the flower-bed yourself,” as he
handed over the bunch.</p>

<p>Dick was taking a drink in the dingy bar-room, and
trying to forget the queer looks that had been cast at his
innocent caravan all the day, when the solitary hall-boy
brought a message summoning him to Miss Euphrosyne’s
room. He went, with his moral tail between his mental
legs.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cutter,” said Miss Euphrosyne, firmly, “we
have made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“It looks that way,” replied Dick, feebly; “but
may be it’s only the&mdash;the ulsters.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Miss Euphrosyne. “The ulsters are a
part of it; but the whole thing is wrong, Mr. Cutter;
and I see it all now. I didn’t realize what it meant.
But my eyes have been opened. Nine young unmarried
women can not go West with a young man&mdash;if you had
heard what people were saying all around us in the cars&mdash;you
don’t know. We’ve got to give up the idea. Oh,
but it was awful!”</p>

<p>Miss Euphrosyne, trembling, hid her face in her
hands. Her tears trickled out through her thin fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the old house is sold! <i>What</i> shall we do?
<i>Where</i> shall we go?” she cried, forgetting Dick utterly,
lost and helpless.</p>

<p>Dick was stalking up and down the room.</p>

<p>“It would be all right,” he demanded, “if there
was a married woman to lead the gang, and if&mdash;if&mdash;if
we caught on to something new in the ulster line?”</p>

<p>“It might be different,” Miss Euphrosyne admitted,
with a sob. Speaking came hard to her. She was tired:
well nigh worn out.</p>

<p>“<i>THEN</i>,” said Dick, with tremendous emphasis,
“what’s the matter with my marrying one of you?”</p>

<p>“<i>Why</i>, Mr. Cutter!” Miss Euphrosyne cried, “I
had no idea that you&mdash;you&mdash;ever&mdash;thought of&mdash;is it
Clytie?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Cutter, “it isn’t Clytie.”</p>

<p>“Is it&mdash;is it&mdash;” Miss Euphrosyne’s eyes lit up
with hope long since extinguished, “is it Aurora?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>Dick Cutter could have been heard three rooms off.</p>

<p>“No!” he said, with all his lungs. “It ain’t Clytie,
nor it ain’t Aurora, nor it ain’t Flora, nor Melpomene
nor Cybele nor Alveolar Aureole nor none of ’em. It’s
<i>YOU</i>&mdash;Y-O-U! I want to marry <i>you</i>, and what’s
more, I’m going to!”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh! oh!” said poor Miss Euphrosyne,
and hid her face in her hands. She had never thought
to be happy, and now she was happy for one moment.
That seemed quite enough for her modest soul. And yet
more was to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>For once in his life, Dick Cutter seized the right
moment to do the right thing. One hour later, Miss
Euphrosyne Bailey was Mrs. Richard Cutter. She did
not know quite how it happened. Clytie told her she
had been bullied into it. But oh! such sweet bullying!</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Richard Cutter one morning in
September of the next year, to Mr. Jack Winfield and
his wife, (Miss Aurora Bailey that was,) “I can’t stop a
minute. We’re too busy up at the ranch. The Wife
has just bought out Wilkinson; and I’ve got to round
up all his stock. I’ll see you next month, at Clytie’s
wedding. Queer, she should have gone off the last,
ain’t it? Euphrosyne and I are going down to Butte City
Monday, to buy her a present. Know anybody who
wants to pay six per cent. for a thousand?”</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE NICE PEOPLE.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap p2"><span class="smdrop">“They</span> certainly are nice people,” I assented to my
wife’s observation, using the colloquial phrase with
a consciousness that it was any thing but “nice” English,
“and I’ll bet that their three children are better
brought up than most of&mdash;“</p>

<p>“<i>Two</i> children,” corrected my wife.</p>

<p>“Three, he told me.”</p>

<p>“My dear, she said there were <i>two</i>.”</p>

<p>“He said three.”</p>

<p>“You’ve simply forgotten. I’m <i>sure</i> she told me
they had only two&mdash;a boy and a girl.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t enter into particulars.”</p>

<p>“No, dear, and you couldn’t have understood him.
Two children.”</p>

<p>“All right,” I said; but I did not think it was all
right. As a near-sighted man learns by enforced observation
to recognize persons at a distance when the face
is not visible to the normal eye, so the man with a bad
memory learns, almost unconsciously, to listen carefully
and report accurately. My memory is bad; but I had
not had time to forget that Mr. Brewster Brede had told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
me that afternoon that he had three children, at present
left in the care of his mother-in-law, while he and Mrs.
Brede took their Summer vacation.</p>

<p>“Two children,” repeated my wife; “and they are
staying with his aunt Jenny.”</p>

<p>“He told me with his mother-in-law,” I put in.
My wife looked at me with a serious expression. Men
may not remember much of what they are told about
children; but any man knows the difference between an
aunt and a mother-in-law.</p>

<p>“But don’t you think they’re nice people?” asked
my wife.</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” I replied. “Only they seem to
be a little mixed up about their children.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t a nice thing to say,” returned my wife.</p>

<p>I could not deny it.</p>

<p>And yet, the next morning, when the Bredes came
down and seated themselves opposite us at table, beaming
and smiling in their natural, pleasant, well-bred
fashion, I knew, to a social certainty, that they <i>were</i>
“nice” people. He was a fine-looking fellow in his
neat tennis-flannels, slim, graceful, twenty-eight or thirty
years old, with a Frenchy pointed beard. She was
“nice” in all her pretty clothes, and she herself was
pretty with that type of prettiness which outwears most
other types&mdash;the prettiness that lies in a rounded figure,
a dusky skin, plump, rosy cheeks, white teeth and black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
eyes. She might have been twenty-five; you guessed
that she was prettier than she was at twenty, and that
she would be prettier still at forty.</p>

<p>And nice people were all we wanted to
make us happy in Mr. Jacobus’s Summer
boarding-house on top of Orange Mountain.
For a week we had come down
to breakfast each morning, wondering
why we wasted the precious days
of idleness with the company gathered
around the Jacobus board.
What joy of human companionship
was to be had out of Mrs.
Tabb and Miss Hoogencamp, the
two middle-aged gossips from Scranton,
Pa.&mdash;out of Mr. and Mrs. Biggle,
an indurated head-bookkeeper and
his prim and censorious wife&mdash;out of old Major Halkit, a
retired business man, who, having once sold a few shares
on commission, wrote for circulars of every stock company
that was started, and tried to induce every one to
invest who would listen to him? We looked around at
those dull faces, the truthful indices of mean and barren
minds, and decided that we would leave that morning.
Then we ate Mrs. Jacobus’s biscuit, light as Aurora’s
cloudlets, drank her honest coffee, inhaled the perfume
of the late azaleas with which she decked her table, and
decided to postpone our departure one more day. And
then we wandered out to take our morning glance at
what we called “our view;” and it seemed to us as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Tabb and Hoogencamp and Halkit and the Biggleses
could not drive us away in a year.</p>

<p>I was not surprised when, after breakfast, my wife
invited the Bredes to walk with us to “our view.” The
Hoogencamp-Biggle-Tabb-Halkit contingent never
stirred off Jacobus’s verandah; but we both felt that the
Bredes would not profane that sacred scene. We strolled
slowly across the fields, passed through the little belt of
woods, and as I heard Mrs. Brede’s little cry of startled
rapture, I motioned to Brede to look up.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he cried, “heavenly!”</p>

<p>We looked off from the brow of the mountain over
fifteen miles of billowing green, to where, far across a
far stretch of pale blue lay a dim purple line that we
knew was Staten Island. Towns and villages lay before
us and under us; there were ridges and hills, uplands
and lowlands, woods and plains, all massed and mingled
in that great silent sea of sunlit green. For silent it
was to us, standing in the silence of a high place&mdash;silent
with a Sunday stillness that made us listen, without
taking thought, for the sound of bells coming up
from the spires that rose above the tree-tops&mdash;the tree-tops
that lay as far beneath us as the light clouds were
above us that dropped great shadows upon our heads
and faint specks of shade upon the broad sweep of land
at the mountain’s foot.</p>

<p>“And so that is <i>your</i> view?” asked Mrs. Brede,
after a moment; “you are very generous to make it
ours, too.”</p>

<p>Then we lay down on the grass, and Brede began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to talk, in a gentle voice, as if he felt the influence of
the place. He had paddled a canoe, in his earlier days,
he said, and he knew every river and creek in that vast
stretch of landscape. He found his landmarks, and
pointed out to us where the Passaic and the Hackensack
flowed, invisible to us, hidden behind great ridges that
in our sight were but combings of the green waves upon
which we looked down. And yet, on the further side of
those broad ridges and rises were scores of villages&mdash;a
little world of country life, lying unseen under our eyes.</p>

<p>“A good deal like looking at humanity,” he said:
“there is such a thing as getting so far above our fellow-men
that we see only one side of them.”</p>

<p>Ah, how much better was this sort of talk than the
chatter and gossip of the Tabb and the Hoogencamp&mdash;than
the Major’s dissertations upon his everlasting
circulars! My wife and I exchanged glances.</p>

<p>“Now, when I went up the Matterhorn,” Mr. Brede
began.</p>

<p>“Why, dear,” interrupted his wife; “I didn’t
know you ever went up the Matterhorn.”</p>

<p>“It&mdash;it was five years ago,” said Mr. Brede, hurriedly.
“I&mdash;I didn’t tell you&mdash;when I was on the other
side, you know&mdash;it was rather dangerous&mdash;well, as I was
saying&mdash;it looked&mdash;oh, it didn’t look at all like this.”</p>

<p>A cloud floated overhead, throwing its great shadow
over the field where we lay. The shadow passed over
the mountain’s brow and reappeared far below, a rapidly
decreasing blot, flying eastward over the golden green.
My wife and I exchanged glances once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Somehow, the shadow lingered over us all. As we
went home, the Bredes went side by side along the narrow
path, and my wife and I walked together.</p>

<p>“<i>Should you think</i>,” she asked me, “that a man
would climb the Matterhorn the very first year he was
married?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, my dear,” I answered, evasively;
“this isn’t the first year I have been married, not by a
good many, and I wouldn’t climb it&mdash;for a farm.”</p>

<p>“You know what I mean,” she said.</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p>When we reached the boarding-house,
Mr. Jacobus took me aside.</p>

<p>“You know,” he began his discourse,
“my wife, she used to live in
N’ York!”</p>

<p>I didn’t know; but I said “Yes.”</p>

<p>“She says the numbers on the
streets runs criss-cross like. Thirty-four’s
on one side o’ the street an’ thirty-five
on t’ other. How’s that?”</p>

<p>“That is the invariable rule, I
believe.”</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;I say&mdash;these here new folk that you ’n’
your wife seem so mighty taken up with&mdash;d’ ye know
any thing about ’em?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about the character of your
boarders, Mr. Jacobus,” I replied, conscious of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
irritability. “If I choose to associate with any of
them&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Jess so&mdash;jess so!” broke in Jacobus. “I hain’t
nothin’ to say ag’inst yer sosherbil’ty. But do ye <i>know</i>
them?”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly not,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;that was all I wuz askin’ ye. Ye see,
when <i>he</i> come here to take the rooms&mdash;you wasn’t here
then&mdash;he told my wife that he lived at number thirty-four
in his street. An’ yistiddy <i>she</i> told her that they
lived at number thirty-five. He said he lived in an
apartment-house. Now there can’t be no apartment-house
on two sides of the same street, kin they?”</p>

<p>“What street was it?” I inquired, wearily.</p>

<p>“Hunderd ’n’ twenty-first street.”</p>

<p>“May be,” I replied, still more wearily. “That’s
Harlem. Nobody knows what people will do in Harlem.”</p>

<p>I went up to my wife’s room.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it’s queer?” she asked me.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll have a talk with that young man
to-night,” I said, “and see if he can give some account
of himself.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear,” my wife said, gravely, “<i>she</i> doesn’t
know whether they’ve had the measles or not.”</p>

<p>“Why, Great Scott!” I exclaimed, “they must
have had them when they were children.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t be stupid,” said my wife. “I meant
<i>their</i> children.”</p>

<p>After dinner that night&mdash;or rather, after supper, for
we had dinner in the middle of the day at Jacobus’s&mdash;I
walked down the long verandah to ask Brede, who was
placidly smoking at the other end, to accompany me on
a twilight stroll. Half way down I met Major Halkit.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

<p>“That friend of yours,” he said, indicating the unconscious
figure at the further
end of the house, “seems to
be a queer sort of a Dick.
He told me that he was out
of business, and just looking
round for a chance to invest
his capital. And I’ve been
telling him what an everlasting
big show he had
to take stock in the Capitoline
Trust Company&mdash;starts
next month&mdash;four
million capital&mdash;I told you
all about it. ‘Oh, well,’ he
says, ‘let’s wait and think
about it.’ ‘Wait!’ says I, ‘the
Capitoline Trust Company won’t wait for <i>you</i>, my boy.
This is letting you in on the ground floor,’ says I ‘and
it’s now or never.’ ‘Oh, let it wait,’ says he. I don’t
know what’s in-<i>to</i> the man.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how well he knows his own business,
Major,” I said as I started again for Brede’s end of the
verandah. But I was troubled none the less. The
Major could not have influenced the sale of one share of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
stock in the Capitoline Company. But that stock was a
great investment; a rare chance for a purchaser with a
few thousand dollars. Perhaps it was no more remarkable
that Brede should not invest than that I should not&mdash;and
yet, it seemed to add one circumstance more to
the other suspicious circumstances.</p>

<p>When I went upstairs that evening, I found my
wife putting her hair to bed&mdash;I don’t know how I can
better describe an operation familiar
to every married man.
I waited until the last
tress was coiled up,
and then I spoke.</p>

<div class="floatright">

<p>“I’ve talked with
Brede,” I said, “and
I didn’t have to catechize
him. He seemed
to feel that some sort
of explanation was
looked for, and he was
very out-spoken. You
were right about the children&mdash;that
is, I must have misunderstood him. There are only
two. But the Matterhorn episode was simple enough.
He didn’t realize how dangerous it was until he had got
so far into it that he couldn’t back out; and he didn’t
tell her, because he’d left her here, you see, and under
the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Left her here!” cried my wife. “I’ve been sitting
with her the whole afternoon, sewing, and she told
me that he left her at Geneva, and came back and took
her to Basle, and the baby was born there&mdash;now I’m
sure, dear, because I asked her.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I was mistaken when I thought he said
she was on this side of the water,” I suggested, with
bitter, biting irony.</p>

<p>“You poor dear, did I abuse you?” said my wife.
“But, do you know, Mrs. Tabb said that <i>she</i> didn’t
know how many lumps of sugar he took in his coffee.
Now that seems queer, doesn’t it.”</p>

<p>It did. It was a small thing. But it looked queer.
Very queer.</p>

<p>The next morning, it was clear that war was declared
against the Bredes. They came down to breakfast
somewhat late, and, as soon as they arrived, the
Biggleses swooped up the last fragments that remained
on their plates, and made a stately march out of the
dining-room. Then Miss Hoogencamp arose and departed,
leaving a whole fish-ball on her plate. Even as
Atalanta might have dropped an apple behind her to
tempt her pursuer to check his speed, so Miss Hoogencamp
left that fish-ball behind her, and between her
maiden self and Contamination.</p>

<p>We had finished our breakfast, my wife and I,
before the Bredes appeared. We talked it over, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
agreed that we were glad that we had not been obliged
to take sides upon such insufficient testimony.</p>

<p>After breakfast, it was the custom
of the male half of the Jacobus
household to go around the corner
of the building and smoke their
pipes and cigars where they
would not annoy the ladies.
We sat under a trellis
covered with a grape-vine
that had borne no grapes in the memory of man. This
vine, however, bore leaves, and these, on that pleasant
Summer morning, shielded from us two persons who
were in earnest conversation in the straggling, half-dead
flower-garden at the side of the house.</p>

<p>“I don’t want,” we heard Mr. Jacobus say, “to
enter in no man’s <i>pry</i>-vacy; but I do want to know
who it may be, like, that I hev in my house. Now
what I ask of <i>you</i>, and I
don’t want you to take
it as in no ways <i>personal</i>,
is&mdash;hev you your
merridge-license with
you?”</p>

<p>“No,” we heard
the voice of Mr. Brede
reply. “Have you
yours?”</p>

<p>I think it was a chance shot; but it told all the
same. The Major (he was a widower), and Mr. Biggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and I looked at each other; and Mr. Jacobus, on the
other side of the grape-trellis, looked at&mdash;I don’t know
what&mdash;and was as silent as we were.</p>

<p>Where is <i>your</i> marriage-license, married reader?
Do you know? Four men, not including Mr. Brede,
stood or sate on one side or the other of that grape-trellis,
and not one of them knew where his marriage-license
was. Each of us had had one&mdash;the Major had
had three. But where were they? Where is <i>yours</i>?
Tucked in your best-man’s pocket; deposited in his desk&mdash;or
washed to a pulp in his white waistcoat (if white
waistcoats be the fashion of the hour), washed out of
existence&mdash;can you tell where it is? Can you&mdash;unless
you are one of those people who frame that interesting
document and hang it upon their drawing-room walls?</p>

<p>Mr. Brede’s voice arose, after an awful stillness
of what seemed like five minutes, and was, probably,
thirty seconds:</p>

<p>“Mr. Jacobus, will you make out your bill at once,
and let me pay it? I shall leave by the six o’clock train.
And will you also send the wagon for my trunks?”</p>

<p>“I hain’t said I wanted to hev ye leave&mdash;” began
Mr. Jacobus; but Brede cut him short.</p>

<p>“Bring me your bill.”</p>

<p>“But,” remonstrated Jacobus, “ef ye ain’t&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Bring me your bill!” said Mr. Brede.</p>

<p>My wife and I went out for our morning’s walk.
But it seemed to us, when we looked at “our view,” as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
if we could only see those invisible villages of which
Brede had told us&mdash;that other side of the ridges and
rises of which we catch no glimpse from lofty hills or
from the heights of human self-esteem. We meant to
stay out until the Bredes had taken their departure; but
we returned just in time to see Pete, the Jacobus darkey,
the blacker of boots, the brusher of coats, the general
handy-man of the house, loading the Brede trunks on
the Jacobus wagon.</p>

<p>And, as we stepped upon the verandah, down came
Mrs. Brede, leaning on Mr. Brede’s arm, as though she
were ill; and it was clear that she had been crying.
There were heavy rings about her pretty black eyes.</p>

<p>My wife took a step toward her.</p>

<p>“Look at that dress, dear,” she whispered; “she
never thought any thing like this was going to happen
when she put <i>that</i> on.”</p>

<p>It was a pretty, delicate, dainty dress, a graceful,
narrow-striped affair. Her hat was trimmed with a
narrow-striped silk of the same colors&mdash;maroon and
white&mdash;and in her hand she held a parasol that matched
her dress.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

</div>

<p>“She’s had a new dress on twice a day,” said my
wife; “but that’s the prettiest yet. Oh, somehow&mdash;I’m
<i>awfully</i> sorry they’re going!”</p>

<p>But going they were. They moved toward the
steps. Mrs. Brede looked toward my wife, and my wife
moved toward Mrs. Brede. But the ostracised woman,
as though she felt the deep humiliation of her position,
turned sharply away, and opened her parasol to shield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
her eyes from the sun. A shower of rice&mdash;a half-pound
shower of rice&mdash;fell down over her pretty hat and her
pretty dress, and fell in a spattering circle on the floor,
outlining her skirts&mdash;and there it lay in a broad, uneven
band, bright in the morning sun.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brede was in my wife’s arms, sobbing as if
her young heart would break.</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor, dear, silly children!” my wife cried,
as Mrs. Brede sobbed on her shoulder, “why <i>didn’t</i>
you tell us?”</p>

<p>“W-W-W-We didn’t want to be t-t-taken
for a b-b-b-b-bridal couple,” sobbed Mrs.
Brede; “and we d-d-didn’t <i>dream</i> what
awful lies we’d have to tell, and all the aw-aw-ful
mixed-up-ness of it. Oh, dear,
dear, dear!”</p>

<p>“Pete!” commanded Mr. Jacobus,
“put back them trunks. These folks
stays here’s long’s they wants ter. Mr.
Brede&mdash;” he held out a large, hard hand&mdash;“I’d
orter’ve known better,” he said. And my last
doubt of Mr. Brede vanished as he shook that grimy
hand in manly fashion.</p>

<p>The two women were walking off toward “our view,”
each with an arm about the other’s waist&mdash;touched by a
sudden sisterhood of sympathy.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Brede, addressing Jacobus,
Biggle, the Major and me, “there is a hostelry down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the street where they sell honest New Jersey beer. I
recognize the obligations of the situation.”</p>

<p>We five men filed down the street. The two
women went toward the pleasant slope where the sunlight
gilded the forehead of the great hill. On Mr.
Jacobus’s verandah lay a spattered circle of shining
grains of rice. Two of Mr. Jacobus’s pigeons flew down
and picked up the shining grains, making grateful noises
far down in their throats.</p>

<h2 class="p4">MR. COPERNICUS AND THE PROLETARIAT.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap p2"><span class="smdrop">The old publishing house</span> of T. Copernicus &amp; Son
was just recovering from the rush of holiday business&mdash;a
rush of perhaps a dozen purchasers. Christmas
shoppers rarely sought out the dingy building just around
the corner from Astor Place, and T. C. &amp; Son had done
no great business since young T. C., the “Son,” died,
fifteen years before. The house lived on two or three
valuable copyrights; and old Mr. Copernicus kept it
alive just for occupation’s sake, now that Tom was dead.
But he liked to maintain the assumption that his queer
old business, with its publication of half-a-dozen scientific
or theological works per annum, was the same flourishing
concern that it had been in his prime. That it did not
flourish was nothing to him. He was rich, thanks to
himself; his wife was rich, thanks to her aunt; his
daughter was rich, thanks to her grandmother. So he
played at business, and every Christmas-time he bought
a lot of fancy stationery and gift-books that nobody
called for, and hired a couple of extra porters for whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the head-porter did his best to find some work. Then,
the week after New Year’s, he would discharge his holiday
hands, and give each of them a dollar or two apiece
out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>“Barney,” he said to the old porter, “you don’t
need those two extra men any longer?”</p>

<p>“‘Deed an’ we do not, sorr!” said Barney; “th’
wan o’ thim wint off av himself the mornin’, an’ t’ other
do be readin’ books the whole day long.”</p>

<p>“Send him to me,” Mr. Copernicus ordered, and
Barney yelled unceremoniously, “Mike!”</p>

<p>The figure of a large and somewhat stout youth,
who might have been eighteen or twenty-eight years
old, appeared, rising from the sub-cellar. His hair was
black, his face was clean-shaven, and although
he held in his hand the evidence of his
guilt, a book kept partly open with his
forefinger, he had an expression of
imperturbable calm, and placid, ox-like
fixity of purpose. He wore a
long, seedy, black frock-coat, buttoned
up to the neck-band of his
collarless shirt.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-156.jpg" width="220" height="248"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“How’s this?” inquired Mr.
Copernicus. “I’m told that you
spend your time reading my books.”
The young man slowly opened his mouth
and answered in a deliberate drawl, agreeably diversified
by a peculiar stutter.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been reading <i>your</i> b-b-books, sir; I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
been reading my own. All I had to do was to hand up
boxes of fuf-fuf-fancy stationery, and&mdash;“</p>

<p>“I see,” interposed Mr. Copernicus, hurriedly,
“there hasn’t been any very great call for fancy stationery
this year.”</p>

<p>“And when there wasn’t any c-c-call for it, I
read. I ain’t going to be a pip-pip-porter all my life.
Would <i>you</i>?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, my boy,” said Mr. Copernicus,
“if you are reading to improve your mind, in your
leisure time&mdash;let’s see your book.”</p>

<p>The young man handed him a tattered duodecimo.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Virgil!” exclaimed his employer.
“You can’t read this.”</p>

<p>“Some of it I kik-kik-can,” returned the employee,
“and some of it I kik-kik-can’t.”</p>

<p>Mr. Copernicus sought out “Arma virumque” and
“Tityre, tu patulæ,” and one or two other passages he
was sure of, and the studious young porter read them
in the artless accent which the English attribute to the
ancient Romans, and translated them with sufficient
accuracy.</p>

<p>“Where did you learn to read Latin?”</p>

<p>“I p-p-picked it up in odd hours.”</p>

<p>“What else have you studied?”</p>

<p>“A little Gig-Gig-Greek.”</p>

<p>“Any thing else?”</p>

<p>“Some algebra and some Fif-Fif-French.”</p>

<p>“Where do you come from?”</p>

<p>“From Baltimore,” drawled the prodigy, utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
unmoved by his employer’s manifest astonishment. “I
was janitor of a school there, and the principal lent me
his bib-bib-books.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“M-M-Michael Quinlan.”</p>

<p>“And what was your father’s business?”</p>

<p>“He was a bib-bib-bricklayer,” the young man
replied calmly, adding, reflectively, “when he wasn’t
did-did-drunk.”</p>

<p>“Bless my old soul!” said Mr. Copernicus to himself,
“this is most extraordinary! I’ll see you again,
young man. Barney!” he called to the head porter,
“this young man will remain with us for the present.”</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-159.jpg" width="220" height="275"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>A couple of days later, Mr. Copernicus sent for
Michael Quinlan, and invited him to call at the Copernican
residence on Washington Square, that evening.</p>

<p>“I want to have Professor Barcalow talk with you,”
he explained.</p>

<p>At the hour appointed, Mr. M. Quinlan presented
himself at the basement door of the old house, and
was promptly translated to the library, where Professor
Barcalow, once President of Clear Creek University,
Indiana, rubbed his bald head and examined the young
man at length.</p>

<p>Quinlan underwent an hour’s ordeal without the
shadow of discomposure.</p>

<p>He drawled and stuttered with a placid face, whether
his answers were right or wrong. At the end of the hour,
the Professor gave his verdict.</p>

<p>“Our young friend,” he said, “has certainly done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
wonders for himself in the way of self-tuition. He is
<i>almost</i> able&mdash;mind, I say <i>almost</i>&mdash;to pass a good
Freshman examination. Of course,
he is not thorough. There is just
the same difference, Mr. Copernicus,
between the tuition you
do for yourself and the tuition
that you receive from a competent
teacher as there is between
the carpentering you do
for yourself and the carpentering
a regular carpenter does
for you. I can see the marks of
self-tuition all over this young
man’s conversation. He has
never met a competent instructor
in his life. But he has done
very well for himself&mdash;wonderfully
well. He in entitled to great credit. Try to remember,
Quinlan, what I told you about the use of the ablative
absolute.”</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-160.jpg" width="250" height="245"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Quinlan said he would, and made his exit by the
basement door.</p>

<p>“If he works hard,” remarked the Professor, “he
will be able to enter Clear Creek by June, and work his
way through.”</p>

<p>“And as it happens,” said Mr. Copernicus, “I’m
going to lose my night-watchman next week, and I
think I’ll put Quinlan in. And then I’ve been thinking&mdash;there
are all poor Tom’s books that he had when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
he went to Columbia. I’ll let the boy come here and
borrow them, and I can keep an eye on him and see
how he’s getting along.”</p>

<p>“H’m! yes, of course,” the
Professor assented hesitatingly,
dubious of Mr. Copernicus’s
classics.</p>

<p>“Well, Barney,” Mr. Copernicus
hailed his head-porter
a month or two later,
“how does our new
night-watchman do?”</p>

<p>“Faith, I’ve seen
worse than him,” said
Barney. “He’s a willing
lad.”</p>

<p>Barney’s heart had been won. He came down to
the store each morning and found that Quinlan had
saved him the trouble of taking off the long sheets of
cotton cloth that protected the books on the counters
from the dust.</p>

<p>Every week thereafter, Quinlan presented himself
at the basement door, shabby, but no longer collarless,
was admitted to the library, by way of the back-stairs,
and received from Mrs. Copernicus the books that Mr.
Copernicus had set aside for him. But one day Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Copernicus forgot the books, and Mrs. Copernicus asked
the young man into the parlor to explain to him how it
had happened. When she had explained, being a kindly
soul, she made a little further conversation, and asked
Quinlan some questions about his studies. Greek was
Greek indeed to her; but when he spoke of French, she
felt as though she had a sort of second-hand acquaintance
with the language.</p>

<p>“Floretta,” she said to her daughter, “talk to Mr.
Quinlan in French, and find out how much he knows.”</p>

<p>Floretta blushed. She was a wren-like little thing,
with soft brown hair, rather pretty, and yet the sort
of girl whom men never notice. To address this male
stranger was an agony to her. But she knew that her
French had been bought at a fashionable boarding-school,
and bought for show, and her mother had a
right to demand its exhibition. She asked M. Quinlan
how he portrayed himself, and M. Quinlan, with no more
expression on his face than a Chinese idol, but with a
fluency checked only by his drawl and his stutter, poured
forth what sounded to Mrs. Copernicus like a small
oration.</p>

<p>“What did he say then, Floretta?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“He said how grateful he was to Papa for giving
him such a chance, and how he wants to be a teacher
when he knows enough. And, oh, Mama, he speaks
<i>ever</i> so much better than <i>I</i> do.”</p>

<p>“Where did you learn to speak so well?” inquired
Mrs. Copernicus, incredulously.</p>

<p>“I lived for some years in a French house, Ma’am.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
At least, the lady of the house was French, and she
never spoke any thing else.”</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-162.jpg" width="250" height="192"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Beneficence is quick to develop into an insidious
habit. When Mr. Copernicus heard this new thing of his
prodigy and protegé, a new idea came to him.</p>

<p>“Old Haverhill, down at the office, speaks French
like a native. I’ll let him feel Quinlan’s teeth, and if he
is as good as you say he is, he’d better come once a
week and talk French to Floretta for an hour. You can
sit in the room. She ought to keep up her French.”</p>

<p>And every Wednesday, from four to five,
Mr. Quinlan and Miss Floretta conversed,
Floretta blushing
ever, Quinlan retaining his
idol-like stolidity. Sometimes
the dull monotony
of his drawl, broken only
by his regular and rhythmic
stutter, lulled Mrs.
Copernicus into a brief
nap over her book or her
fancy work.</p>

<p>Spring had come. The trees had brought out their
pale and gauzy green veils, the beds of tulips and Alpine
daisies made glad spots in the parks, and Quinlan, at his
employer’s suggestion, had purchased a ready made
Spring suit, in which he looked so presentable that Mr.
Copernicus was half minded to ask him to dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>For Mrs. Copernicus had said something to Mr.
Copernicus that had set him to thinking of many things.
The Chinese idol had abated no jot of his stolidity, and
yet&mdash;perhaps&mdash;he had found a worshiper. Floretta
began blushing of Wednesdays, a full hour before the
lesson.</p>

<p>What was to come of it? On the face of it, it seemed
impossible. A Quinlan and a Copernicus! And yet&mdash;great-grandfather
Copernicus, who founded the family in
America&mdash;was not he a carpenter? And did not his
descendants point with pride to his self-made solidity?
And here was native worth; high ambition; achievement
that promised more. And Floretta was twenty-four,
and had never had an offer. “What,” inquired
Mr. Copernicus of himself, “is my duty toward the
proletariat?”</p>

<p>One thing was certain. If the question was not settled
in the negative at once, Quinlan must be educated.
So, instead of inviting Quinlan to dinner, he invited Mr.
Joseph Mitts, the traveling agent of the Hopkinsonian
Higher Education Association, who, by a rare
chance, was in town.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-163.jpg" width="200" height="276"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Cynical folk said that the Hopkinsonian
Association existed only to sell certain textbooks
and curious forms of stationery which
were necessary to the Hopkinsonian system.
But no such idea had ever entered the head
of Mr. Mitts. He roamed about the land,
introducing the System wherever he could, and
a brisk business agent followed him and sold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the Hopkinsonian Blackboards and the Hopkinsonian
Ink and the Hopkinsonian Teachers’ Self-Examination
Blanks, on commission.</p>

<p>As they smoked their cigars in the Library after
dinner, Mr. Copernicus told Mr. Mitts about Quinlan.
Mr. Mitts was interested. He knew a Professor at a
fresh-water college who would put Quinlan through his
studies during the vacation.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s settled,” Mr. Copernicus said, and he
beamed with satisfaction. “I knew you’d help me out,
Mitts. Only it’s so hard ever to get a sight of you&mdash;you
are always traveling about.”</p>

<p>“We don’t often meet,” Mr. Mitts assented. “And
it is curious that this visit should have been the means
of giving me sight of a man in whom I want to interest
<i>you</i>. His name is Chester&mdash;Dudley Winthrop Chester.
He is the son of my old clergyman, and he has given
his parents a deal of trouble. I don’t know that Dud
ever was vicious or dissolute. But he was the most confirmed
idler and spendthrift I ever knew. He couldn’t
even get through college, and he never would do a
stroke of work. He made his father pay his debts half
a dozen times, and when that was stopped, he drifted
away, and his family quite lost sight of him. I met him
in Baltimore last year, and lent him money to come to
New York. He said he was going to work. And just
as I came in your front door, I saw him going out of
your basement door with a package under his arm, so
I infer he is employed by one of your trades-people&mdash;your
grocer, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Just as you came in? Why&mdash;a large, dark-haired
young man?”</p>

<p>“Yes; clean-shaven.”</p>

<p>“Why, that was Quinlan!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Mitts, with the smile of superior
knowledge. “It was Chester, and if I’m not mistaken,
he was kissing the cook.”</p>

<p>“Then you <i>are</i> mistaken!” cried Mr. Copernicus;
“my cook is as black as the ace of spades. There isn’t
a white servant in the house.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s so!” Mr. Mitts was staggered for
the moment. “But&mdash;wait a minute&mdash;does your man
Quinlan speak with a drawl, and just one stutter to the
sentence?”</p>

<p>“I think he does,” replied his host; “but&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Dudley Chester!” said Mr. Mitts.</p>

<p>“But, my dear Mitts, where did he get the Latin
and Greek?”</p>

<p>“He had to learn <i>something</i> at Yale.”</p>

<p>“And the French?”</p>

<p>“His mother was a French Canadian. That’s
where he gets his French&mdash;and his laziness.”</p>

<p>Mr. Copernicus made one last struggle.</p>

<p>“But he has been most industrious and faithful in
my employ.”</p>

<p>“What is he?”</p>

<p>“My&mdash;my night-watchman.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Copernicus,” inquired Mr. Mitts, “have you a
watchman’s clock in your building?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Mr. Copernicus, indignantly. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
have none of those degrading new-fangled machines. I
prefer to trust my employees.”</p>

<p>“Then Dudley Chester is asleep in your store at
this minute.”</p>

<p>A soft, moist breeze, with something of the sea in
it, blew gently in at an open window of the second
floor of the business establishment of T. Copernicus &amp;
Son. Near the window a gas-jet flickered. Under the
gas-jet, on, or rather in, a bed ingeniously constructed
of the heaped-up covering-cloths from the long counters,
lay Mr. Michael Quinlan, half-supported on his left
elbow. In his other hand he held, half-open, a yellow-covered
French novel. Between his lips was a cigarette.
A faint shade of something like amusement lent expression
to his placid features as he listened to Mr. Copernicus
puffing his way up the stairs, followed by Mr.
Mitts and Barney. The hands on the clock pointed to
eleven. Mr. Quinlan’s attire was appropriate to the
hour. He wore only a frayed cotton night-shirt. His
other clothes were carelessly disposed about his couch.</p>

<p>He waited calmly until his visitors had appeared
before him, and then he greeted them with a gracious
wave of his hand&mdash;an easy gesture that seemed to
dismiss Quinlan and announce Chester.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he drawled, “you’ll excuse my not
gig-gig-getting up to welcome you. Ah, Joseph! I saw
you this evening, and I supposed the j-j-jig was up.”</p>

<p>Mr. Copernicus was purple and speechless for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
better part of a minute. Then he demanded, in a husky
whisper:</p>

<p>“<i>Who are you?</i>”</p>

<p>Mr. Chester, with nothing of the Quinlan left about
him, waved his hand once more.</p>

<p>“Mr. Joseph Mitts is a gentleman of irre-pip-pip-proachable
veracity,” he said. “I can kik-kik-confidently
confirm any statements he has made about me.”</p>

<p>“And why&mdash;” Mr. Copernicus had found his voice&mdash;“why
have you humbugged me in this iniquitous&mdash;infamous
way?”</p>

<p>The late Quinlan gazed at him with blank surprise.</p>

<p>“My dear sir, did-did-don’t you see? If I’d told
you who I was, you’d have thought I was a did-did-damn
fool not to know more than I did. Whereas, don’t you
see? you thought I was a did-did-devil of a fellow.”</p>

<p>“Get up and dress yourself and get out of here!”
said his employer.</p>

<p>“The jig, then,” inquired Mr. Dudley Chester,
slowly rising, “is did-did-definitely up? No more Fif-Fif-French
lessons? No? Well,” he continued, as he
leisurely pulled on his trousers, “that’s the kik-kik-cussèd

but when you thought I was a did-did-damn
Mick, I was right in the bib-bib-bosom of the blooming
family.”</p>

<p>“Here are your week’s wages,” said Mr. Copernicus,
trembling with rage. “Now, get out!”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” responded the unperturbed sinner:
“a ticket to Chicago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you had best yield,” whispered Mr.
Mitts. “Your family, you know. It wouldn’t do to
have this get out.”</p>

<p>Mr. Copernicus had a minute of purple rage. Then
he handed the money to Mr. Mitts.</p>

<p>“Put him on the train,” he said. “There’s one
at twelve.”</p>

<p>“We can make it if we hurry,” said the obliging
Mr. Mitts. “Where’s your lodging-house, Chester?”</p>

<p>Chester opened his eyes inquiringly. “Why, this
is all I’ve got,” he said; “what’s the mim-mim-matter
with this?”</p>

<p>“But your&mdash;your luggage?” inquired Mr. Mitts.</p>

<p>Mr. Chester waved a much-worn tooth-brush in
the air.</p>

<p>“Man wants but lil-lil-little here below,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“You see,” explained Mr. Dudley Winthrop Chester,
formerly Quinlan, as he stepped out into the night
air with Mr. Mitts, “the scheme is bib-bib-busted here,
but I’ve got confidence in it. It’s good&mdash;it’ll gig-gig-go.
Chicago’s the pip-pip-place for me. I suppose
if you flash up ‘amo, amas’ to a Chicago man,

asked Mr. Mitts, sternly.</p>

<p>“You can bib-bib-bet I am,” responded Chester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
frankly; “I haven’t said a cuss-word in six months.
Did-did-did-damn&mdash;damn&mdash;damn&mdash;damn!” he vociferated
into the calm air of night, by
way of relieving his pent-up feelings.
“How long is it, Dudley,” pursued
the patient Mitts, “since
your parents heard from you?”</p>

said Chester. “By
Jove,” he added, as his eye
fell on the blue sign of a telegraph
office, “did-did-damn if
I don’t telegraph them right now.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mitts was deeply gratified. “That’s a good
idea,” he said.</p>

Dudley Chester.</p>

<p>At midnight sharp, Mr. Mitts saw his
charge ascend the rear platform of the
Chicago train just as it moved out of the
gloomy Jersey City station of the Pennsylvania
Railroad.</p>

<p>A young woman of slight figure, with
a veil about her face, emerged from the
interior of the car and threw her arms
around the neck of Mr. Chester, late Quinlan.</p>

<p>“I thought I wasn’t mistaken,” said Mr. Mitts to
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The next week he received an envelope containing
a scrap roughly torn out of a daily paper. It read as

<h2 class="p4">HECTOR.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap p2"><span class="smdrop">It was</span> such a quiet old home, so comfortably covered
with wistaria from basement to chimney-tops, and it
stood on the corner of two such quiet, old-fashioned
streets on the East side of New York that you would
never have imagined that it held six of the most agitated
and perturbed women in the great city. But the three
Miss Pellicoes, their maid, their waitress and their cook,
could not have been more troubled in
their feminine minds had they
been six exceptionally attractive
Sabines with the Roman
soldiery in full cry.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-173.jpg" width="220" height="338"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>For twenty years&mdash;ever
since the death of old Mr.
Pellicoe&mdash;these six women
had lived in mortal fear of
the marauding man, and the
Man had come at last. That
very evening, at a quarter past
eight o’clock, a creature who called
himself a book-agent had rung the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
front door bell. Honora, the waitress, had opened the
door a couple of inches, inquired the stranger’s business,
learned it, told him to depart, tried to close the door,
and discovered that the man had inserted his toe in the
opening. She had closed the door violently, and the
man had emitted a single oath of deep and sincere profanity.
He had then kicked the door and departed, with
a marked limp.</p>

<p>At least this was the story as Honora first related it.
But as she stood before the assembled household and
recounted it for the seventh time, it had assumed proportions
that left no room for the charitable hypothesis that
an innocent vendor of literature had been the hapless
victim of his own carelessness or clumsiness.</p>

<p>“And whin he had the half of his big ugly body
in the crack o’ th’ dure,” she said, in excited tones and
with fine dramatic action, “and him yellin’ an’ swearin’
and cussin’ iv’ry holy name he could lay his black tongue
to, and me six years cook in a convent, and I t’rew th’
whole weight o’ me on th’ dure, an’&mdash;“</p>

<p>“That will do, Honora,” said Miss Pellicoe, who
was the head of the household. She perceived that the
combat was deepening too rapidly. “You may go. We
will decide what is to be done.”</p>

<p>And Miss Pellicoe had decided what was to be done.</p>

<p>“Sisters,” she said to her two juniors, “we must
keep a dog.”</p>

<p>“A dog!” cried Miss Angela, the youngest; “oh,
how nice!”</p>

<p>“I do not think it is nice at all,” said Miss Pellicoe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
somewhat sternly, “nor would you, Angela, if you had
any conception of what it really meant. I do not propose
to keep a lap-dog, or a King Charles spaniel, but a
<i>dog</i>&mdash;a mastiff, or a bloodhound, or some animal of
that nature, such as would spring at the throat of an
invader, and bear him to the ground!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” gasped Miss Angela. “I should be
afraid of him!”</p>

<p>“You do not understand as yet, Angela,” Miss
Pellicoe explained, knitting her brows. “My intention
is to procure the animal as a&mdash;in fact&mdash;a puppy, and
thus enable him to grow up and to regard us with affection,
and be willing to hold himself at all times in readiness
to afford us the protection we desire. It is clearly
impossible to have a man in the house. I have decided
upon a mastiff.”</p>

<p>When Miss Pellicoe decided upon a thing, Miss
Angela Pellicoe and her other sister promptly acquiesced.
On this occasion they did not, even in their inmost
hearts, question the wisdom of the decision of the head
of the house. A man, they knew, was not to be thought
of. For twenty years the Pellicoe house had been a
bower of virginity. The only men who ever entered it
were the old family doctor, the older family lawyer, and
annually, on New Year’s Day, in accordance with an
obsolete custom, Major Kitsedge, their father’s old
partner, once junior of the firm of Pellicoe &amp; Kitsedge.
Not ever the butcher or the baker or the candlestick-maker
forced an entrance to that innocent dovecote.
They handed in their wares through a wicket-gate in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
back yard and were sent about their business by the
chaste Honora.</p>

<p>The next morning, having awakened to find themselves
and the silver still safe, Miss Pellicoe and Miss
Angela set out for a dog store which they had seen advertised
in the papers. It was in an unpleasantly low
and ill-bred part of the town, and when the two ladies
reached it, they paused outside the door, and listened,
with lengthened faces, to the combined clamor and smell
that emanated from its open door.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-176.jpg" width="250" height="278"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“This,” said Miss
Pellicoe, after a brief
deliberation, “is not
a place for <i>us</i>. If
we are to procure a
dog, he must be procured
in some
other way. It need
not entail a loss of
self-respect.”</p>

<p>“I have it!”
she added with a
sudden inspiration.
“I will write
to Hector.”</p>

<p>Hector was the sole male representative of the Pellicoe
family. He was a second cousin of the Misses
Pellicoe. He lived out West&mdash;his address varying from
year to year. Once in a long while Miss Pellicoe wrote
to him, just to keep herself in communication with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Man of the family. It made her feel more secure, in
view of possible emergencies. She had not seen Hector
since he was nineteen. He was perhaps the last person
of any positive virility who had had the freedom of the
Pellicoe household. He had used that freedom mainly
in making attempts to kiss Honora, who was then in her
buxom prime, and in decorating the family portraits with
cork moustaches and whiskers. Miss Pellicoe clung to
the Man of the family as an abstraction; but she was
always glad that he lived in the West. Addressing him
in his capacity of Man of the family, she wrote to him
and asked him to supply her with a young mastiff, and
to send her bill therefor. She explained the situation to
him, and made him understand that the dog must be of
a character to be regarded as a male relative.</p>

<p>Hector responded at once. He would send a mastiff
pup within a week. The pup’s pedigree was, unfortunately,
lost, but the breed was high. Fifty dollars would
cover the cost and expenses of transportation. The pup
was six months old.</p>

<p>For ten days the Pellicoe household was in a fever
of expectation. Miss Pellicoe called in a carpenter, and,
chaperoned by the entire household, held an interview
with him, and directed him how to construct a dog-house
in the back-yard&mdash;a dog-house with one door about six
inches square, to admit the occupant in his innocent
puphood, and with another door about four feet in height
to emit him, when, in the pride of his mature masculinity,
he should rush forth upon the burglar and the
book-agent. The carpenter remarked that he “never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
seen no such a dorg as that;” but Miss Pellicoe thought
him at once ignorant and ungrammatical, and paid no
heed to him.</p>

<p>In conclave assembled, the Misses Pellicoe decided
to name the dog Hector. Beside the consideration of
the claims of gratitude and family affection, they remembered
that Hector was a classical hero.</p>

<p>The ten days came to an end when, just at dusk of
a dull January day, two stalwart expressmen, with much
open grumbling and smothered cursing, deposited a huge
packing-case in the vestibule of the Pellicoe house, and
departed, slamming the doors behind them. From this
box proceeded such yelps and howls that the entire
household rushed affrighted to peer through the slats
that gridironed the top. Within was a mighty black
beast, as high as a table, that flopped itself wildly about,
clawed at the sides of the box, and swung in every direction
a tail as large as a policeman’s night-club.</p>

<p>It was Hector. There was no mistake about it, for
Mr. Hector Pellicoe’s card was nailed to a slat. It was
Hector, the six-months-old pup, for whose diminutive
proportions the small door in the dog-house had been
devised; Hector, for whom a saucer of lukewarm milk
was even then waiting by the kitchen range.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sister!” cried Miss Angela, “we <i>never</i> can
get him out! You’ll have to send for a <i>man</i>!”</p>

<p>“I certainly shall not send for a <i>man</i> at this hour
of the evening,” said Miss Pellicoe, white, but firm;
“and I shall not leave the poor creature imprisoned
during the night.” Here Hector yawped madly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shall take him out,” concluded Miss Pellicoe,
“<i>myself</i>!”</p>

<p>They hung upon her neck, and entreated her not to
risk her life; but Miss Pellicoe had made up her mind.
The three maids shoved the box into the butler’s pantry,
shrieking with terror every time that Hector leaped at
the slats, and at last, with the two younger Pellicoes
holding one door a foot open, and the three maids holding
the other door an inch open, Miss Pellicoe seized the
household hatchet, and began her awful task. One slat!
Miss Pellicoe was white but firm. Two slats! Miss
Pellicoe was whiter and firmer. Three slats!&mdash;and a
vast black body leaped high in the air. With five simultaneous
shrieks, the two doors were slammed to, and
Miss Pellicoe and Hector were left together in the butler’s
pantry.</p>

<p>The courage of the younger Pellicoes asserted itself
after a moment, and they flung open the pantry door.
Miss Pellicoe, looking as though she needed aromatic
vinegar, leaned against the wall. Hector had his fore-paws
on her shoulders, and was licking her face in
exuberant affection.</p>

<p>“Sisters,” gasped Miss Pellicoe, “will you kindly
remove him? I should like to faint.”</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-180.jpg" width="250" height="204"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>But Hector had already released her to dash at Miss
Angela, who frightened him by going into such hysterics
that Miss Pellicoe was obliged to deny herself the luxury
of a faint. Then he found the maids, and, after driving
them before him like chaff for five minutes, succeeded
in convincing Honora of the affectionate purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
his demonstrations, and accepted her invitation to the
kitchen, where he emptied the saucer of milk in
three laps.</p>

<p>“I think, Honora,” suggested Miss Pellicoe, who
had resumed command, “that you
might, perhaps, give him a
slice or two of last night’s
leg of mutton. Perhaps
he needs something more
sustaining.”</p>

<p>Honora produced the
mutton-leg. It was clearly
what Hector wanted. He
took it from her without ceremony,
bore it under the sink and
ate all of it except about six inches of the bone, which
he took to bed with him.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-181.jpg" width="200" height="342"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The next day, feeling the need of masculine advice,
Miss Pellicoe resolved to address herself to the policeman
on the beat, and she astonished him with the following
question:</p>

<p>“Sir,” she said, in true Johnsonian style, “what
height should a mastiff dog attain at the age of six
months?”</p>

<p>The policeman stared at her in utter astonishment.</p>

<p>“They do be all sizes, Mum,” he replied, blankly,
“like a piece of cheese.”</p>

<p>“My relative in the West,” explained Miss Pellicoe,
“has sent me a dog, and I am given to understand that
his age is six months. As he is phenomenally large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
I have thought it best to seek for information.
Has my relative been imposed upon?”</p>

<p>“It’s har-r-rd to tell, Mum,” replied
the policeman, dubiously. Then his countenance
brightened. “Does his feet
fit him?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what do you mean?”
asked Miss Pellicoe, shrinking back
a little.</p>

<p>“Is his feet like blackin’-boxes on
th’ ind of his legs?”</p>

<p>“They are certainly very large.”</p>

<p>“Thin ’tis a pup. You see, Mum,
with a pup, ’tis this way. The feet starts
first, an’ the pup grows up to ’em, like. Av they match
him, he’s grown. Av he has arctics on, he’s a pup.”</p>

<p>Hector’s growth in the next six months dissipated
all doubts as to his puphood. He became a four-legged
Colossus, martial toward cats, aggressive toward the
tradesmen at the wicket-gate, impartially affectionate
toward all the household, and voracious beyond all imagining.
But he might have eaten the gentle ladies out
of house and home, and they would never have dreamed
of protesting. The house had found a Head&mdash;even a
Head above Miss Pellicoe.</p>

<p>The deposed monarch gloried in her subjection.
She said “Hector likes this,” or “Hector likes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>,”
with the tone of submissive deference in which you may
hear a good wife say, “Mr. Smith <i>will not</i> eat cold
boiled mutton,” or “Mr. Smith is very particular about
his shirt-bosoms.”</p>

<p>As for Miss Angela, she never looked at Hector,
gamboling about the back-yard in all his superabundance
of strength and vitality, without feeling a half-agreeable
nervous shock, and a flutter of the heart. He stood for
her as the type of that vast outside world of puissant
manhood of which she had known but two specimens&mdash;her
father and Cousin Hector. Perhaps, in the old days,
if Cousin Hector had not been so engrossed in frivolity
and making of practical jokes, he might have learned of
something to his advantage. But he never did.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life, Miss Angela found
herself left to watch the house through the horrors of
the Fourth of July. This had always been Miss Pellicoe’s
duty; but this year Miss Pellicoe failed to come
back from the quiet place in the Catskills, where no
children were admitted, and where the Pellicoe family,
two at a time, spent the Summer in the society of other
old maids and of aged widows.</p>

<p>“I feel that you are safe with Hector,” she wrote.</p>

<p>Alack and alack for Miss Pellicoe’s faith in Hector!
The first fire-cracker filled him with excitement, and
before the noises of the day had fairly begun, he was
careering around the yard, barking in uncontrollable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
frenzy. At twelve o’clock, when the butcher-boy came
with the chops for luncheon, Hector bounded through
the open wicket, right into the arms of a dog-catcher.
Miss Angela wrung her hands as
she gazed from her window and saw the
Head of the House cast into the cage
with a dozen curs of the street and
driven rapidly off.</p>

<p>In her lorn anguish she sought
the functionary who was known in the
house as “Miss Pellicoe’s policeman.”</p>

<p>“Be aisy, Miss,” he said. “Av
the dog is worth five dollars, say, to yez,
I have a friend will get him out for th’ accommodation.”</p>

<p>“Oh, take it, take it!” cried Miss Angela, trembling
and weeping.</p>

<p>After six hours of anxious waiting, Miss Angela
received Hector at the front door, from a boy who turned
and fled as soon as his mission was accomplished. Hector
was extremely glad to be at home, and his health
seemed to be unimpaired; but to Miss Angela’s delicate
fancy, contact with the vulgar of his kind had left a
vague aroma of degradation about him. With her own
hands she washed him in tepid water and sprinkled him
with eau de cologne. And even then she could not help
feeling that to some extent the bloom had been brushed
from the peach.</p>

<p>Hector was ill&mdash;very ill. The family conclave
assembled every night and discussed the situation with
knit brows and tearful eyes. They could not decide
whether the cause of his malady was the unwholesomeness
of the Summer air in the city, or whether it was
simply over-feeding. He was certainly shockingly fat,
and much indisposed to exertion. He had lost all his
activity; all his animal spirits. He spent most of the
time in his house. Even his good-nature was going.
He had actually snapped at Honora. They had tried to
make up their minds to reduce his rations; but their
hearts had failed them. They had hoped that the cool
air of September would help him; but September was
well nigh half gone; and Hector grew worse and worse.</p>

<p>“Sisters,” said Miss Pellicoe, at last, “we shall have
to send for a Veterinary!” She spoke as though she had
just decided to send for an executioner. And even as the
words left her lips there came from Hector such a wail of
anguish that Miss Pellicoe’s face turned a ghastly white.</p>

<p>“He is going mad!” she cried.</p>

<p>There was no sleep in the Pellicoe household that
night, although Hector wailed no more. At the break
of day, Miss Pellicoe led five other white-faced women
into the back yard.</p>

<p>Hector’s head lay on the sill of his door. He seemed
too weak to rise, but he thrashed his tail pleasantly
against the walls, and appeared amiable and even cheerful.
The six advanced.</p>

<p>Miss Pellicoe knelt down and put her hand in to
pet him. Then a strange expression came over her face.</p>

<p>“Sister,” she said, “I <i>think</i>&mdash;a cat has got in and
bitten him.”</p>

<p>She closed her hand on something soft, lifted it out
and laid it on the ground. It was small, it was black, it
was dumpy. It moved a round head in an uncertain,
inquiring way, and tried to open its tightly-closed eyes.
Then it squeaked.</p>

<p>Thrice more did Miss Pellicoe thrust her hand into
the house. Thrice again did she bring out an object
exactly similar.</p>

<p>“Wee-e-e-e!” squeaked the four objects. Hector
thrashed her tail about and blinked joyfully, all unconscious
of the utter wreck of her masculinity, looking as
though it were the most natural thing in the world for
her to have a litter of pups&mdash;as, indeed, it was.</p>

<p>Honora broke the awful silence,&mdash;Miss Angela was
sobbing so softly you could scarcely hear her.</p>

<p>“Be thim Hector’s?” Honora inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Honora!” said Miss Pellicoe, rising, “never utter
that name in my presence again.”</p>

<p>“An’ fwat shall I call the dog?”</p>

<p>“Call <i>it</i>”&mdash;and Miss Pellicoe made a pause of impressive
severity, “call <i>it</i>&mdash;Andromache.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">A SISTERLY SCHEME.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap p2"><span class="smdrop">Away up</span> in the very heart of Maine there is a mighty
lake among the mountains. It is reached after a
journey of many hours from the place where you “go
in.” That is the phrase of the country, and when you
have once “gone in,” you know why it is not correct to
say that you have gone <i>through</i> the woods, or, simply,
<i>to</i> your destination. You find that you have plunged
into a new world&mdash;a world that has nothing in common
with the world that you live in; a world of wild, solemn,
desolate grandeur, a world of space and silence; a world
that oppresses your soul&mdash;and charms you irresistibly.
And after you have once “come out” of that world, there
will be times, to the day of your death, when you will be
homesick for it, and will long with a childlike longing to
go back to it.</p>

<p>Up in this wild region you will find a fashionable
Summer-hotel, with electric bells and seven-course dinners,
and “guests” who dress three times a day. It is
perched on a little flat point, shut off from the rest of
the mainland by a huge rocky cliff. It is an impertinence
in that majestic wilderness, and Leather-Stocking would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
doubtless have had a hankering to burn such an affront
to Nature; but it is a good hotel, and people go to it and
breathe the generous air of the
great woods.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

</div>

<p>On the beach near this
hotel, where the canoes were
drawn up in line, there stood
one Summer morning a curly-haired,
fair young man&mdash;not
so very young, either&mdash;whose
cheeks were uncomfortably red
as he looked first at his own
canoe, high and dry, loaded
with rods and landing-net and
luncheon-basket, and then at
another canoe, fast disappearing
down the lake, wherein sat
a young man and a young woman.</p>

<p>“Dropped again, Mr. Morpeth?”</p>

<p>The young man looked up and saw a saucy face
laughing at him. A girl was sitting on the string-piece of
the dock. It was the face of a girl between childhood
and womanhood. By the face and the figure, it was a
woman grown. By the dress, you would have judged
it a girl.</p>

<p>And you would have been confirmed in the latter
opinion by the fact that the young person was doing
something unpardonable for a young lady, but not inexcusable
in the case of a youthful tomboy. She had
taken off her canvas shoe, and was shaking some small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
stones out of it. There was a tiny hole in her black
stocking, and a glimpse of her pink toe was visible. The
girl was sunburnt, but the toe was prettily pink.</p>

<p>“Your sister,” replied the young man with dignity,
“was to have gone fishing with me; but she remembered
at the last moment that she had a prior engagement
with Mr. Brown.”</p>

<p>“She hadn’t,” said the girl. “I heard them make
it up last evening, after you went upstairs.”</p>

<p>The young man clean forgot himself.</p>

<p>“She’s the most heartless coquette in the world!”
he cried, and clinched his hands.</p>

<p>“She is all that,” said the young person on the
string-piece of the dock, “and more too. And yet, I
suppose, you want her all the same?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I do,” said the young man, miserably.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the girl, putting her shoe on again,
and beginning to tie it up, “I’ll tell you what it is, Mr.
Morpeth. You’ve been hanging around Pauline for a
year, and you are the only one of the men she keeps on
a string who hasn’t snubbed me. Now, if you want me
to, I’ll give you a lift.”</p>

<p>“A&mdash;a&mdash;<i>what</i>?”</p>

<p>“A lift. You’re wasting your time. Pauline has
no use for devotion. It’s a drug in the market with her&mdash;has
been for five seasons. There’s only one way to
get her worked up. Two fellows tried it, and they nearly
got there; but they weren’t game enough to stay to the
bitter end. I think you’re game, and I’ll tell you.
You’ve got to make her jealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Make her jealous of me?”</p>

<p>“No!” said his friend, with infinite scorn; “make
her jealous of the other girl. <i>Oh!</i> but you men are
stupid!”</p>

<p>The young man pondered a moment.</p>

<p>“Well, Flossy,” he began, and then he became
conscious of a sudden change in the atmosphere, and
perceived that the young lady was regarding him with
a look that might have chilled his soul.</p>

<p>“Miss Flossy&mdash;Miss Belton&mdash;” he hastily corrected
himself. Winter promptly changed to Summer in Miss
Flossy Belton’s expressive face.</p>

<p>“Your scheme,” he went on, “is a good one. Only&mdash;it
involves the discovery of another girl.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Miss Flossy, cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the young man, “doesn’t it strike
you that if I were to develop a sudden admiration for
any one of these other young ladies whose charms I
have hitherto neglected, it would come tardy off&mdash;lack
artistic verisimilitude, so to speak?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” was Miss Flossy’s prompt and frank
response; “especially as there isn’t one of them fit to
flirt with.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, where am I to discover the girl?”</p>

<p>Miss Flossy untied and retied her shoe. Then she
said, calmly:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with&mdash;” a hardly perceptible
hesitation&mdash;“<i>me?</i>”</p>

<p>“With <i>you?</i>” Mr. Morpeth was startled out of his
manners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>Mr. Morpeth simply stared.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” suggested Miss Flossy, “I’m not good-looking
enough?”</p>

<p>“You are good-looking enough,” replied Mr. Morpeth,
recovering himself, “for <i>anything</i>&mdash;” and he
threw a convincing emphasis into the last word as he
took what was probably his first real inspection of his
adored one’s junior&mdash;“but&mdash;aren’t you a trifle&mdash;young?”</p>

<p>“How old do you suppose I am?”</p>

<p>“I know. Your sister told me. You are sixteen.”</p>

<p>“Sixteen!” repeated Miss Flossy, with an infinite
and uncontrollable scorn, “yes, and I’m the kind of
sixteen that stays sixteen till your elder sister’s married.
I was eighteen years old on the third of last December&mdash;unless
they began to double on me before I was old
enough to know the difference&mdash;it would be just like
Mama to play it on me in some such way,” she concluded,
reflectively.</p>

<p>“Eighteen years old!” said the young man. “The
deuce!” Do not think that he was an ill-bred young
man. He was merely astonished, and he had much more
astonishment ahead of him. He mused for a moment.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “what’s your plan of campaign?
I am to&mdash;to discover you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Miss Flossy, calmly, “and to flirt with
me like fun.”</p>

<p>“And may I ask what attitude you are to take when
you are&mdash;discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the imperturbable Flossy. “I
am going to dangle you.”</p>

<p>“To&mdash;to dangle me?”</p>

<p>“As a conquest, don’t you know. Let you hang
round and laugh at you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed?”</p>

<p>“There, don’t be wounded in your masculine pride.
You might as well face the situation. You don’t think
that Pauline’s in love with you, do you?”</p>

<p>“No!” groaned the young man.</p>

<p>“But you’ve got lots of money. Mr. Brown has
got lots more. You’re eager. Brown is coy. That’s
the reason that Brown is in the boat and you are on the
cold, cold shore, talking to Little Sister. Now if Little
Sister jumps at you, why, she’s simply taking Big Sister’s
leavings; it’s all in the family, any way, and there’s
no jealousy, and Pauline can devote her whole mind to
Brown. There, <i>don’t</i> look so limp. You men are simply
childish. Now, after you’ve asked me to marry you&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m to ask you to marry me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. You needn’t look frightened, now. I
won’t accept you. But then you are to go around like a
wet cat, and mope, and hang on worse then ever. Then
Big Sister will see that she can’t afford to take that sort
of thing from Little Sister, and then&mdash;there’s your
chance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s my chance, is it?” said Mr. Morpeth.
He seemed to have fallen into the habit of repetition.</p>

<p>“There’s your <i>only</i> chance,” said Miss Flossy, with
decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Morpeth meditated. He looked at the lake,
where there was no longer sign or sound of the canoe,
and he looked at Miss Flossy, who sat calm, self-confident
and careless, on the string-piece of the dock.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how feasible&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>“It’s feasible,” said Miss Flossy, with decision.
“Of course Pauline will write to Mama, and of course
Mama will write and scold me. But she’s got to stay in
New York, and nurse Papa’s gout; and the Miss Redingtons
are all the chaperons we’ve got up here, and
they don’t amount to any thing&mdash;so I don’t care.”</p>

<p>“But why,” inquired the young man; and his tone
suggested a complete abandonment to Miss Flossy’s idea:
“why should you take so much trouble for <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Morpeth,” said Miss Flossy, solemnly, “I’m
two years behind the time-table, and I’ve got to make a
strike for liberty, or die. And besides,” she added, “if
you are <i>nice</i>, it needn’t be such an <i>awful</i> trouble.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morpeth laughed.</p>

<p>“I’ll try to make it as little of a bore as possible,”
he said, extending his hand. The girl did not take it.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-196.jpg" width="220" height="233"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“Don’t make any mistake,” she cautioned him,
searching his face with her eyes; “this isn’t to be any
little-girl affair. Little Sister doesn’t want any kind,
elegant, supercilious encouragement from Big Sister’s
young man. It’s got to be a <i>real</i> flirtation&mdash;devotion
no end, and ten times as much as ever Pauline could get
out of you&mdash;and you’ve got to keep your end ’way&mdash;’&mdash;’way
up!”</p>

<p>The young man smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll keep my end up,” he said; “but are you
certain that you can keep yours up?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think so,” replied Miss Flossy. “Pauline
will raise an awful row; but if she goes too
far, I’ll tell my age, <i>and hers, too</i>.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morpeth looked in Miss Flossy’s
calm face. Then he extended his hand
once more.</p>

<p>“It’s a bargain, so far as I’m concerned,”
he said.</p>

<p>This time a soft and small hand
met his with a firm, friendly, honest
pressure.</p>

<p>“And I’ll refuse you,” said Miss Flossy.</p>

<p>Within two weeks, Mr. Morpeth found himself entangled
in a flirtation such as he had never dreamed of.
Miss Flossy’s scheme had succeeded only too brilliantly.
The whole hotel was talking about the outrageous behavior
of “that little Belton girl” and Mr. Morpeth, who
certainly ought to know better.</p>

<p>Mr. Morpeth had carried out his instructions. Before
the week was out, he found himself giving the most
life-like imitation of an infatuated lover that ever delighted
the old gossips of a Summer-resort. And yet he
had only done what Flossy told him to do.</p>

<p>He got his first lesson just about the time that
Flossy, in the privacy of their apartments, informed
her elder sister that if she, Flossy, found Mr. Morpeth’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
society agreeable, it was nobody’s concern but her own,
and that she was prepared to make some interesting
additions to the census statistics if any one thought differently.</p>

<p>The lesson opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” she said, “that it wouldn’t be a
bit of a bad idea to telegraph to New York for some real
nice candy and humbly present it for my acceptance? I
<i>might</i> take it&mdash;if the bonbonnière was pretty enough.”</p>

<p>He telegraphed to New York and received, in the
course of four or five days, certain marvels of sweets
in a miracle of an upholstered box. The next day he
found her on the verandah, flinging the bonbons on the
lawn for the children to scramble for.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-197.jpg" width="200" height="346"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“Awfully nice of you to send me
these things,” she said languidly, but
loud enough for the men around
her to hear&mdash;she had men around
her already: she had been discovered&mdash;“but
I never eat sweets,
you know. Here, you little mite
in the blue sash, don’t you want
this pretty box to put your doll’s
clothes in?”</p>

<p>And Maillard’s finest bonbonnière
went to a yellow-haired brat
of three.</p>

<p>But this was the slightest and lightest of her caprices.
She made him send for his dog-cart and his horses,
all the way from New York, only that he might drive her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
over the ridiculous little mile-and-a-half of road that
bounded the tiny peninsula. And she christened him
“Muffets,” a nickname presumably suggested by “Morpeth”;
and she called him “Muffets” in the hearing of
all the hotel people.</p>

<p>And did such conduct pass unchallenged? No.
Pauline scolded, raged, raved. She wrote to Mama.
Mama wrote back and reproved Flossy. But Mama could
not leave Papa. His gout was worse. The Miss Redingtons
must act. The Miss Redingtons merely wept, and
nothing more. Pauline scolded; the flirtation went on;
and the people at the big hotel enjoyed it immensely.</p>

<p>And there was more to come. Four weeks had
passed. Mr. Morpeth was hardly on speaking terms with
the elder Miss Belton; and with the younger Miss Belton
he was on terms which the hotel gossips characterized as
“simply scandalous.” Brown glared at him when they
met, and he glared at Brown. Brown was having a hard
time. Miss Belton the elder was not pleasant
of temper in those trying days.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Miss Flossy to
Mr. Morpeth, “it’s time you
proposed to me, Muffets.”</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-198.jpg" width="220" height="197"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>They were sitting on the
hotel verandah, in the evening
darkness. No one was
near them, except an old
lady in a Shaker chair.</p>

<p>“There’s Mrs. Melby.
She’s pretending to be asleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
but she isn’t. She’s just waiting for us. Now walk me
up and down and ask me to marry you so that she can
hear it. It’ll be all over the hotel inside of half an hour.
Pauline will just <i>rage</i>.”</p>

<p>With this pleasant prospect before him, Mr. Morpeth
marched Miss Flossy Belton up and down the long
verandah. He had passed Mrs. Melby three times before
he was able to say, in a choking, husky, uncertain voice:</p>

<p>“Flossy&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I <i>love</i> you!”</p>

<p>Flossy’s voice was not choking nor uncertain. It
rang out clear and silvery in a peal of laughter.</p>

<p>“Why, of course you do, Muffets, and I wish you
didn’t. That’s what makes you so stupid half the time.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;” said Mr. Morpeth, vaguely; “but I&mdash;“</p>

<p>“But you’re a silly boy,” returned Miss Flossy;
and she added in a swift aside: “<i>You haven’t asked me
to marry you!</i>”</p>

<p>“W-W-W-Will you be my wife?” stammered Mr.
Morpeth.</p>

<p>“No!” said Miss Flossy, emphatically, “I will not.
You are too utterly ridiculous. The idea of it! No,
Muffets, you are charming in your present capacity; but
you aren’t to be considered seriously.”</p>

<p>They strolled on into the gloom at the end of the
great verandah.</p>

<p>“That’s the first time,” he said, with a feeling of
having only the ghost of a breath left in his lungs, “that
I ever asked a woman to marry me.”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” said Miss Flossy, “from the
way you did it. And you were beautifully rejected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
weren’t you. Now&mdash;look at Mrs. Melby, will you?
She’s scudding off to spread the news.”</p>

<p>And before Mr. Morpeth went to bed, he was aware
of the fact that every man and woman in the hotel knew
that he had “proposed” to Flossy Belton, and had been
“beautifully rejected.”</p>

<p>Two sulky men, one sulky woman, and one girl
radiant with triumphant happiness started out in two
canoes, reached certain fishing-grounds known only to
the elect, and began to cast for trout. They had indifferent
luck. Miss Belton and Mr. Brown caught a dozen
trout; Miss Flossy Belton and Mr. Morpeth caught
eighteen or nineteen, and the day was wearing to a
close. Miss Flossy made the last cast of the day, just as
her escort had taken the paddle. A big trout rose&mdash;just
touched the fly&mdash;and disappeared.</p>

<p>“It’s this wretched rod!” cried Miss Flossy; and
she rapped it on the gunwale of the canoe so sharply that
the beautiful split-bamboo broke sharp off in the middle
of the second-joint. Then she tumbled it overboard,
reel and all.</p>

<p>“I was tired of that rod, any way, Muffets,” she said;
“row me home, now; I’ve got to dress for dinner.”</p>

<p>Miss Flossy’s elder sister, in the other boat, saw and
heard this exhibition of tyranny; and she was so much
moved that she stamped her small foot, and endangered
the bottom of the canoe. She resolved that Mama should
come back, whether Papa had the gout or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Morpeth, wearing a grave expression, was paddling
Miss Flossy toward the hotel. He had said nothing
whatever, and it was a noticeable silence that Miss Flossy
finally broke.</p>

<p>“You’ve done pretty much everything that I wanted
you to do, Muffets,” she said; “but you haven’t saved
my life yet, and I’m going to give you a chance.”</p>

<p>It is not difficult to overturn a canoe. One twist of
Flossie’s supple body did it, and before
he knew just what had happened,
Morpeth was swimming toward
the shore, holding up Flossy
Belton with one arm, and
fighting for life in the icy
water of a Maine lake.</p>

<p>The people were running
down, bearing blankets
and brandy, as he touched bottom in his last desperate
struggle to keep the two of them above water. One
yard further, and there would have been no strength
left in him.</p>

<p>He struggled up on shore with her, and when he
got breath enough, he burst out:</p>

<p>“Why did you do it? It was wicked! It was cruel!”</p>

<p>“There!” she said, as she reclined composedly in
his arms, “that will do, Muffets. I don’t want to be
scolded.”</p>

<p>A delegation came along, bringing blankets and
brandy, and took her from him.</p>

<p>At five o’clock of that afternoon, Mr. Morpeth presented
himself at the door of the parlor attached to the
apartments of the Belton sisters. Miss Belton, senior,
was just coming out of the room. She received his
inquiry after her sister’s health with a white face and a
quivering lip.</p>

<p>“I should think, Mr. Morpeth,” she began, “that
you had gone far enough in playing with the feelings of
a m-m-mere child, and that&mdash;oh! I have no words to
express my <i>contempt</i> for you!”</p>

<p>And in a most unladylike rage Miss Pauline Belton
swept down the hotel corridor.</p>

<p>She had left the door open behind her. Morpeth
heard a voice, weak, but cheery, addressing him from
the far end of the parlor.</p>

<p>“You’ve got her!” it said. “She’s crazy mad. She’ll
make up to you to-night&mdash;see if she don’t.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morpeth looked up and down the long corridor.
It was empty. He pushed the door open, and entered.
Flossy was lying on the sofa, pale, but
bright-eyed.</p>

<p>“You can get her,” she whispered,
as he knelt down beside her.</p>

<p>“Flossy,” he said, “don’t you
know that that is all ended? Don’t
you know that I love you and you
only? Don’t you know that I haven’t
thought about any one else since&mdash;since&mdash;oh,
Flossy, don’t you&mdash;is it possible that you don’t
understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>Flossy stretched out two weak arms, and put them
around Mr. Morpeth’s neck.</p>

<p>“Why have I had you in training all Summer?”
said she. “Did you think it was for Pauline?”</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2"><span class="smdrop">Through a thickly falling snow</span>, on the outskirts
of one of New York’s suburban towns, (a hamlet of
some two hundred thousand population,) walked a man
who had but one desire in the world
ungratified. His name was Richard
Brant, and he was a large,
deep-chested, handsome man&mdash;a
man’s man; hardly a
woman’s man at all: and yet
the sort of man that is likely
to make a pretty serious matter
of it if he loves a woman,
or if a woman loves him.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Brant came from the West, the Western-born
child of Eastern-born parents. He made his
fortune before he was thirty-five, and for five years he
had been trying to find out what he wanted to do with
that fortune. He was a man of few tastes, of no vices,
and of a straight-forward, go-ahead spirit that set him
apart from the people who make affectation the spice of
life. He wanted only one thing in the world, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
one thing money would not buy for him. So he was
often puzzled as to how he might best spend his money;
and he often spent it foolishly. As he walked
through the suburban streets of the suburban
city, this sharp Winter’s night, he
was reflecting on the folly of spending
money on a fur coat. He was wearing
the coat&mdash;a magnificent affair of bearskin
and sable.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-208a.jpg" width="200" height="332"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“South of Canada,” he said to himself,
“this sort of thing is vulgar and
unnecessary. <i>I</i> don’t need it, any more
than a cow needs a side-pocket. It’s too
beastly hot for comfort at this moment.
I’d carry it over my arm, only that I should
feel how absurdly heavy it really is.”</p>

<p>Then he looked ahead through the thick snow,
and, although he was a man of strong nerves, he started
and stepped back like a woman who sees a cow.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar’s Ghost!” said he.</p>

<p>He was justified in calling thus upon the
most respectable spook of antiquity. The
sight he saw was strange enough in itself:
seen in the squalid, commonplace
sub-suburban street, it was
bewildering. There, ahead of him,
walked Mephistopheles&mdash;Mephistopheles
dressed in a red flannel
suit, trimmed with yellow,
all peaks and points; and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the head of Mephistopheles was an old, much worn,
brown Derby hat.</p>


<p>Brant caught Mephisto by the shoulder and turned
him around. He was a slight, undersized man of fifty,
whose moustache and goatee, dyed an impossible black,
served only to accentuate the meagre commonness of
his small features.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-208b.jpg" width="220" height="308"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded Brant.</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h!” said the shivering figure, “lemme go!
I’m Zozo!”</p>

<p>Brant stared at him in amazement. What was it?
A walking advertisement&mdash;for an automatic toy or a
new tooth-powder?</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said the slim man, his teeth chattering,
“lemme get along. I’m most freezing. I’m
Zozo&mdash;the astrologer. Why&mdash;don’t you know?&mdash;on
Rapelyea Street?”</p>

<p>Brant dimly remembered that there was a Rapelyea
Street, through which he sometimes passed on his way
to the railroad station, and he had some faint memory
of a gaudily painted shanty decked out with the signs
of the zodiac in gilt <i>papier maché</i>.</p>

<p>“My orfice got a-fire this evening,” explained Zozo,
“from the bakery next door. And I had to light out
over the back fence. Them people in that neighborhood
is kinder superstitious. They ain’t no idea of astrology.
They don’t know it’s a Science. They think
it’s some kind of magic. And if they’s to see me
drove out by a common, ordinary fire, they’d think I
was no sort of an astrologer. So I lit out quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>His teeth chattered so that he made ten syllables
out of “quiet.”</p>

<p>“They don’t understand the Science of it,” he continued,
“and the fire got at my street clo’es before I
knew it, and so I had to light out mighty quick. Now,
jes’ lemme get home, will you? This here flannel ain’t
no fur coat.”</p>

<p>Brant’s coat came off his shoulders in an instant.</p>

<p>“Put this on,” he said. “Confound you!&mdash;” as
the man resisted,&mdash;“<i>put it on!</i>”</p>

<p>The astrologer slipped into the coat with a gasp
of relief.</p>

<p>“Cracky!” he cried, “but I was freezin’!”</p>

<p>“Do you live far from here?” Brant inquired.</p>

<p>“Just a bit up the road. I’m ’most home, now,”
replied Zozo, still chattering as to his teeth.</p>

<p>As they walked along the half-built street, Zozo
told his tale. He had been in the astrology business for
thirty years, and it had barely yielded him a living.
Yet he had been able, by rigorous economy, to save up
enough money to build himself a house&mdash;“elegant
house, sir,” he said; “‘tain’t what you may call <i>large</i>;
but it’s an elegant house. I got the design out of a
book that cost a dollar, sir, a dollar. There ain’t no use
in trying to do things cheap when you’re going to build
a house.”</p>

<p>But his joy in his house was counterbalanced by
his grief for the loss of his “orfice.” He had taken the
ground-rent of the city lot, and had erected the “orfice”
at his own cost. Three hundred and twenty-seven dollars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
he had spent on that modest structure. No, he had not
insured it. And now the bakery had caught fire, and
his “orfice” was burned to the ground, and his best suit
of street-clothes with it&mdash;his only suit, as he owned
after a second’s hesitation.</p>

<p>In ten minutes’ walk they arrived at Zozo’s house.
It was quite the sort of house that might have come out
of a dollar book, with a great deal of scroll-work about
it, and with a tiny tower, adorned with fantastically
carved shingles. As they stood on the porch&mdash;nothing
would content Zozo but that his new friend should come
in and warm himself&mdash;Mr. Brant looked at the name
on the door-plate.</p>

<p>“Zozo’s only my name in the Science,” the astrologer
explained. “My real name&mdash;my born name&mdash;is
Simmons. But I took Zozo for my business name. ‘Zs’
seem to kinder go with the astrology business, somehow&mdash;I
don’t know why. There’s Zadkiel, and Zoroaster,
and&mdash;oh, I don’t know&mdash;they’re ‘Zs’ or ‘Xs’, most
of ’em; and it goes with the populace. I don’t no more
like humoring their superstition than you would; but a
man’s got to live; and the world ain’t up to the Science
yet. Oh, that’s you, Mommer, is it?” he concluded,
as the door was opened by a bright, buxom, rather
pretty woman. “Mother ain’t to bed yet, is she? Say,
Mommer, the orfice is burnt down!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Popper!” cried the poor woman; “you don’t
reelly say!”</p>

<p>“True’s I live,” said the astrologer, “and my
street-clo’es, too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Popper!” his wife cried, “what’ll we do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Mommer, I don’t know. We’ll
have to think. Jes’ let this here gentleman in, though.
I’d most ’a’ froze if he hadn’t lent me the loan of his
overcoat. My sakes!” he broke out, as he looked at the
garment in the light of the hall-lamp, “but that cost
money. Mommer, this here’s Mr.&mdash;&mdash; I ain’t caught
your name, sir.”</p>

<p>“Brant,” said the owner of the name.</p>

<p>“Band. And a reel elegant gentleman he is, Mommer.
I’d ‘a’ froze stiff in my science clo’es if’t hadn’t
been for this coat. My sakes!” he exclaimed, reverently,
“never <i>see</i> the like! That’d keep a corpse warm. Shut
the door, Mommer, an’ take the gentleman into the
dining-room. He must be right cold himself. Is Mother
there?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Zozo’s wife, “and so’s Mamie. You
was so late we all got a kinder worried, and Mamie
come right down in her nighty, just before you come in.
‘Where’s Popper?’ sez she; ‘ain’t he came in yet to
kiss me good night? ’Tain’t mornin’, is it?’ sez she. <i>And</i>
the orfice burned down! Oh, my, Popper! I thought our
troubles was at an end. Come right in, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;I
ain’t rightly got your name; but thank you kindly for
looking after Popper, and if you had an <i>i</i>dee how easy
he takes cold on his chist, you’d know how thankful I
am. Come right into the dinin’-room. Mother, this is
Mr. Band, and he lent Simmons the loan of his coat to
come home with. Wa’n’t it awful?”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” croaked a very old woman in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
corner of the dining-room. It was a small dining-room,
with a small extension-table covered with a cheap red
damask cloth.</p>

<p>“Simmons’s orfice is burned up, and his best suit
with it,” explained Mrs. Simmons. “Ain’t it awful!”</p>

<p>“It’s a jedgement,” said the old lady, solemnly.
She was a depressing old lady. And yet she evidently
was much revered in the family. A four-year-old child
hung back in a corner, regarding her grandmother with
awe. But when her father entered, she slipped up to his
knee, and took his kisses silently, but with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Only one we’ve got,” said Zozo, as he sat down
and took her on his knee. “Born under Mercury and
Jupiter&mdash;if that don’t mean that she’ll be on top of the
real-estate boom in this neighborhood, I ain’t no astrologer.
Yes, Ma,” he went on, addressing the old woman,
who gave no slightest sign of interest, “the orfice
burned down, and I had to get home quick. Wouldn’t
’a’ done for them Rapelyea Street folks to see me, scuttin’
off in my orfice clo’es.”</p>

<p>He had shed Brant’s huge overcoat, and his wife
was passing her hand over his thin flannel suit.</p>

<p>“Law, Simmons!” she said, “you’re all wet!”</p>

<p>“I’ll dry all right in these flannels,” said Zozo.
“Don’t you bother to get no other clo’es.”</p>

<p>He had forgotten that he had told Brant that the
suit in his office was his only suit. Or perhaps he wished
to spare his wife the humiliation of such an admission.</p>

<p>“I’m dryin’ off first-rate,” he said, cheerfully;
“Mamie, Popper ain’t wet where you’re settin’, is he?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
No. Well, now, Mommer, you get out the whiskey and
give Mr.&mdash;Mr. Band&mdash;a glass, with some hot water,
and then he won’t get no chill. We’re all pro’bitionists
here,” he said, addressing Brant, “but we b’lieve in
spirits for medicinal use. Yes, Mother, you’d oughter’ve
seen that place burn. Why, the flames was on me before
I know’d where I was, and I jist thought to myself,
thinks I, if these here people see me a-runnin’ away
from a fire, I won’t cast no horoscope in Rapelyea Street
after <i>this</i>; and I tell <i>you</i>, the way I got outer the back
window and over the back fence was a caution! There’s
your whiskey, sir: you’ll excuse me if I don’t take none
myself. We ain’t in the habit here.”</p>

<p>Brant did not greatly wonder at their not being
in the habit when he tasted the whiskey. It was bad
enough to wean a toper on. But he sipped it, and made
overtures to the baby. And after a while she showed an
inclination to come and look at his wonderful watch, that
struck the hour when you told it to. Before long she was
sitting on his knee. Her father was telling the female
members of the family about the fire, and she felt both
sleepy and shut out. She played with Brant’s watch for
a while, and then fell asleep on his breast. He held her
tenderly, and listened to the astrologer as he told his
pitiful tale over and over again, trying to fix the first
second when he had smelled smoke.</p>

<p>He was full of the excitement of the affair: too full
of the consciousness of his own achievement to realize
the extent of the disaster. But his wife suddenly broke
down, crying out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Simmons! where’ll you get three hundred
dollars to build a new orfice?”</p>

<p>Brant spoke up, but very softly, lest he might wake
the baby, who was sleeping with her head on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I’ll be happy to&mdash;to advance the money,” he said.</p>

<p>Zozo looked at him almost sourly.</p>

<p>“I ain’t got no security to give you. This is a
Building Society house, and there’s all the mortgage
on it that it’s worth. I couldn’t do no better,” he
concluded, sullenly.</p>

<p>Brant had been poor enough himself to understand
the quick suspicion of the poor. “Your note will do,
Mr. Simmons,” he said; “I think you will pay me back.
I sha’n’t worry about it.”</p>

<p>But it was some time before the Simmons family
could understand that a loan of the magnitude of three
hundred dollars could be made so easily. When the
glorious possibility did dawn upon them, nothing would
do but that Mr. Brant should take another drink of
whiskey. It was not for medicinal purposes this time;
it was for pure conviviality; and Brant was expected,
not being a prohibitionist, to revel vicariously for the
whole family. He drank, wondering what he had at
home to take the taste out of his mouth.</p>

<p>Then he handed the baby to her mother, and started
to go. But Simmons suddenly and unexpectedly turned
into Zozo, and insisted on casting his benefactor’s horoscope.
His benefactor told him the day of his birth, and
guessed at the hour. Zozo figured on a slate, drawing
astronomical characters very neatly indeed, and at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
began to read off the meaning of his stellar stenography,
in a hushed, important voice.</p>

<p>He told Brant everything that had happened to
him, (only none of it <i>had</i> happened; but Brant did not
say him nay.) Then he told him various things that
were to happen to him; and Zozo cheered up greatly
when his impassive and sleepy guest sighed as he spoke
of a blonde woman who was troubling his heart, and who
would be his, some day. There was a blonde woman
troubling Brant’s heart; but there was small probability
of her being his some day or any day. And then Zozo
went on to talk about a dark woman who would disturb
the course of true love; but only temporarily and as a
side issue, so to speak.</p>

<p>“She ain’t serious,” he said. “She may make a
muss; but she ain’t reel serious.”</p>

<p>“Good night!” said Brant.</p>

<p>“You don’t b’lieve in the Science,” said Zozo, in a
voice of genuine regret. “But you jist see if it don’t
come true. Good night. Look out you don’t trip over
the scraper.”</p>

<p>The blonde woman in Mr. Brant’s case was Madame
la Comtesse de Renette. No, she was not a French woman:
she was a loyal American. She was the daughter
of an American millionaire; she had lived for many years
in France, and her parents had married her, at the age
of eighteen, to a title. The title was owned by a disagreeable
and highly immoral old spendthrift, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
led her a wretched life for two weary years, and then
had had the unusual courtesy and consideration to die.
Then she took what he had left of her millions, went
home to the town of her birth, bought a fine estate on
its outskirts, and settled down to enjoy a life wherein she
could awake each morning to feel that the days would
never more bring her suffering and humiliation.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Richard Brant disturbed her peace of
mind by falling in love with her, and what was worse,
asking her to marry him. That, she said, she could not
do. He was her best, her dearest friend: she admired
and esteemed him more than any man in the world. If
she ever <i>could</i> marry a man, she would marry him. But
she never, never could. He must not ask her.</p>

<p>Of course, he did ask her. And he asked her more
than once. And there matters stood, and there they
seemed likely to stay.</p>

<p>But Richard Brant was a man who, when he wanted
a thing, wanted it with his whole heart and his whole
soul, and to the exclusion of every other idea from his
mind. After eighteen months of waiting, he began to
find the situation intolerable. He had no heart in his
business&mdash;which, for the matter of that, took care of
itself&mdash;and he found it, as he said to himself, “a chore
to exist.” And what with dwelling on the unattainable,
and what with calling on the unattainable once or twice
every week, he found that he was getting into a morbid
state of mind that was the next thing to a mild mania.</p>

<p>“This has got to stop,” said Richard Brant. “I
will put an end to it. I will wait till an even two years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
is up, and then I will go away somewhere where I <i>can’t</i>
get back until&mdash;until I’ve got over it.”</p>

<p>Opportunity is never lacking to a man in this
mood. Some scientific idiot was getting up an Antarctic
expedition, to start in the coming June. Brant applied
for a berth.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” he said.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-218.jpg" width="220" height="255"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Of course, it didn’t settle it. He moped as much
as ever and found it just as hard as ever to occupy his
mind. If it had not been for the astrologer, he would
hardly have known what to do.</p>

<p>It amused him to interest himself in
Zozo and his affairs. He watched
the building of the new “orfice”,
and discussed with Zozo the
color of the paint and the style
of the signs. Zozo tried to
convert him to astrology, and
that amused him. The little
man’s earnest faith in this
“science” was an edifying study.</p>

<p>Then, when the “orfice” was completed,
and Zozo began business again, he took great
pleasure in sitting hid in Zozo’s back room, listening to
Zozo’s clients, who were often as odd as Zozo himself.
He had many clients now. Had he not miraculously
evanished from a burning building, and come back unscathed?</p>

<p>But there are two sides to every friendship. Brant
took an amused interest in Zozo. Zozo worshiped Brant
as his preserver and benefactor. Zozo’s affairs entertained
Brant. Brant’s affairs were a matter of absorbing concern
to Zozo. Zozo would have died for Brant.</p>

<p>So it came about that Zozo found out all about the
blonde lady in Brant’s case. How? Well, one is not
an astrologer for nothing. Brant’s coachman and Mme.
de Renette’s maid were among Zozo’s clients. No society
gossip knew so much about the Brant-Renette affair as
Zozo knew, inside of two months.</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly ridiculous, Annette! I <i>can’t</i> see

<p>“Madame knows best,” said Annette, wiping away
a ready tear. “It is only that I love Madame. And it
is not well to anger those who have the power of magic.
If they can bring good luck, they can bring bad. And
he is certainly a great magician. Fire can not burn him.”</p>

<p>Mme. de Renette toyed with a gorgeously-printed

awe.</p>

Mme. de Renette, somewhat sternly.</p>

<p>“Madam,” began her visitor, in
a tremulous voice, “I come with a
message from the stars.”</p>

de Renette, “will you kindly

Zozo who stopped Richard
Brant on the street an hour later.</p>

<p>“If you please, Mr. Brant, sir,” he said; “I’d like
a few minutes of your time.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Mr. Brant, wondering if Zozo
wanted to borrow any more money.</p>

<p>“You’ve been a great good friend to me, Mr.
Brant,” Zozo began, “and I hope you b’lieve, sir, that
me and Mommer and Ma Simmons and Mamie are jist

<p>“‘The blonde lady!’” broke in Brant.</p>

<p>“Madam dee Rennet,” explained Zozo.</p>

<p>“The devil!” said Brant.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, knowin’ that, as I done, and knowin’
that there couldn’t be nothin’ <i>to</i> it&mdash;no

Mr. Brant, sir&mdash;but only jist that her
mind wasn’t at ease with regard

<p>“Great heavens!” Brant
yelled. “You infernal meddler!
what have you done? I don’t know

have you said?&mdash;oh, curse it!” he cried, as he realized,
from the pain of its extinction, that hope had been alive
in his heart, “what <i>have</i> you done?&mdash;you devil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether there is or not, Richard,”
said Mme. de Renette, with icy distinctness; “but I
know that there won’t be, after&mdash;well, sir, could you
break your June engagement for&mdash;me?”</p>

<p>And Zozo was justified.</p>

<p class="drop-capi p1"><span class="smdrop">I suppose the</span> Tullingworth-Gordons
were good Americans
at heart; but the Tullingworth-Gordons
were of
English extraction, and, as
somebody once said, the
extraction had not been
completely successful&mdash;a
great deal of the English
soil clung to the roots of
the family tree.</p>

<p>They lived on Long Island, in a very English way,
in a manor-house which was as English as they could
make it, among surroundings quite respectably English
for Americans of the third or fourth generation.</p>

<p>They had two English servants and some other
American “help”; but they called the Americans by
their last names, which anglified them to some extent.
They had a servants’ hall, and a butler’s pantry, and a
page in buttons, and they were unreasonably proud of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the fact that one of their Tory ancestors had been obliged
to leave New York for Halifax, in 1784, having only the
alternative of a more tropical place of residence. I do
not know whether they really held that the signers of
the Declaration of Independence committed a grave
error; but I do know that when they had occasion to
speak of Queen Victoria, they always referred to her as
“Her Majesty.”</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-226.jpg" width="250" height="121"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“I see by the <i>Mail</i> to-night,”
Mr. Tullingworth-Gordon
would say
to his wife, “that Her
Majesty has presented
the poor bricklayer who
saved seventeen lives and
lost both arms at the Chillingham-on-Frees
disaster with an India shawl and a copy of the
Life of the Prince Consort.”</p>

<p>“Her Majesty is always <i>so</i> generous!” Mrs. Tullingworth-Gordon
would sigh; “and <i>so</i> considerate of the
common people!”</p>

<p>Mr. Tullingworth-Gordon was a rich man, and he
was free to indulge the fancy of his life, and to be as
English as his name; and he engaged those two English
servants to keep up the illusion.</p>

<p>It is the tale of the menials that I have to tell&mdash;the
tale of the loves of Samuel Bilson, butler, and
Sophronia Huckins, “which ’Uckins it ever was an’ so it
were allays called, and which ’Uckins is good enough for
me, like it was good enough for my parents now departed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and there is ’ope for ’eaven for chapel-goers, though a
Church-of-England woman I am myself.”</p>

<p>Sophronia Huckins was lady’s maid to Mrs. Tullingworth-Gordon,
housekeeper to Mr. and Mrs. Tullingworth-Gordon,
and, in a way, autocrat and supreme ruler
over the whole house of Tullingworth-Gordon. There
were other servants, as I have said, but, in their several
departments, Bilson and Sophronia were king and queen.
Of course, at the first, there was some friction between
these two potentates. For ten years they scratched and
sparred and jostled; for ten years after that they lived in
comfortable amity, relieving their feelings by establishing
a reign of terror over the other servants; and then&mdash;ah,
then&mdash;began the dawn of another day. Bilson was
careless about the wine; Sophronia took to the wearing
of gowns unbefitting a maid of forty years. It broke upon
the Tullingworth-Gordon mind that something was in the
wind, and that the conservative quiet of their domestic
service was likely to be troubled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nature, unconscious of the proprieties
of the situation, was having her own way in the little
passage back of the butler’s pantry.</p>

<p>“You say”&mdash;the housekeeper spoke with a certain
sternness&mdash;“as how you have loved me for ten long
years. But I say as how it would ’ave been more to
your credit, Samuel Bilson, to ’ave found it out afore
this, when, if I do say it myself, there was more
occasion.”</p>

<p>“It’s none the wuss, Sophronia, for a-bein’ found
out now,” rejoined the butler, sturdily: “what you was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
you is to me, an’ I don’t noways regret that you ain’t
what you was, in point of beauty, to ’ave young men an’
sich a-comin’ between us, as an engaged pair.”</p>

<p>“‘Oo’s an engaged pair?” demanded Sophronia,
with profound dignity.</p>

<p>“Us,” said Mr. Bilson, placidly: “or to be considered
as sich.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t considered us as sich,” said Sophronia,
coquettishly: “not as yet.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bilson was stacking up dishes
on the shelves in the passageway.
He paused in his labors;
put his hands on his hips, and
faced his tormenting charmer
with determination in his eye.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-228.jpg" width="220" height="385"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“Sophronia ’Uckins!” he
said: “you’re forty, this day
week; that much I know.
Forty’s forty. You’ve kep’
your looks wonderful, an’ you
’ave your teeth which Providence
give you. But forty’s
forty. If you mean Bilson,
you mean Bilson now, ’ere
in this ’ere cupboard-extension,
your ’and an’ your ’art,
to love, honor, an’ obey, so
’elp you. Now, ’ow goes it?”</p>

<p>It went Mr. Bilson’s way.
Sophronia demurred, and for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
space of some few weeks she was doubtful; then she
said “No”&mdash;but in the end she consented.</p>

<p>Why should she not? Bilson had been a saving
man. No luxurious furniture beautified his little room
over the stables. His character was above reproach.
He allowed himself one glass of port each day from Mr.
Tullingworth-Gordon’s stock; but there he drew the
line. Such as it was, the master of the house had his
own wine, every drop, except that solitary glass of port&mdash;save
on one occasion.</p>

<p>And Sophronia Huckins was the occasion of that
occasion. Smooth and decorous ran the course of true
love for four months on end. Mrs. Tullingworth-Gordon
had been made acquainted with the state of affairs; had
raged, had cooled, and had got to that point where the
natural woman arose within her, and she began to think
about laying out a trousseau for the bride. Fair was the
horizon; cloudless the sky. Then came the heavy blow
of Fate.</p>

<p>When Cupid comes to you at forty years, he is
likely to be something wrinkled, more or less fat and
pursy, a trifle stiff in the joints. You must humor him a
little; you must make believe, and play that he is young
and fair. It takes imagination to do this, and in imagination
Sophronia was deficient. Her betrothal was not two
months old when she suddenly realized that there was
something grotesque and absurd about it. How did she
get the idea? Was it an echo of the gossip of the other
servants? Did she see the shop-keepers, quick to catch
all the local gossip, smiling at her as she went about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
little town on her domestic errands? Was there something
in Bilson’s manners that told her that he felt, in
his inmost heart, that he had got to the point where he
had to take what he could get, and that he held her
lucky to have been conveniently accessible at that critical
juncture?</p>

<p>We can not know. Perhaps Bilson was to blame.
A man may be in love&mdash;over head and ears in love&mdash;and
yet the little red feather of his vanity will stick out
of the depths, and proclaim that his self-conceit is not
yet dead.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was Bilson: perhaps it was some other
cause. It matters not. One dull November day, Sophronia
Huckins told Samuel Bilson that she could not and
would not marry him.</p>

<p>“It was my intent, Samuel; but I ’ave seen it was
not the thing for neither of us. If you had ’a’ seen your
way clear five or ten or may befifteen years ago, I don’t
say as it wouldn’t ’a’ been different. But as to sich a
thing <i>now</i>, I may ’ave been foolish a-listenin’ to you last
July; but what brains I ’ave is about me now, an’ I tell
you plain, Samuel Bilson, it can’t never be.”</p>

<p>To Bilson this came like a clap of thunder out of
the clearest and sunniest of skies. If the Cupid within
him had grown old and awkward, he was unaware of it.
To his dull and heavily British apprehension, it was the
same Cupid that he had known in earlier years. The
defection of his betrothed was a blow from which he
could not recover.</p>

<p>“Them women,” he said, “is worse’n the measles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
You don’t know when they’re comin’ out, an’ you don’t
know when they’re goin’ in.”</p>

<p>The blow fell upon him late one evening, long after
dinner; when everything had been put to rights. He
was sitting in the butler’s pantry, sipping his one glass of
port, when Sophronia entered and delivered her dictum.</p>

<p>She went out and left him&mdash;left him with
the port. She left him with the sherry;
she left him with the claret, with the old,
old claret, with the comet year, with the
wine that had rounded the Cape, with
the Cognac, with the Chartreuse,
with the syrupy Curaçoa and the
Eau de Dantzic, and with the
Scotch whiskey that Mr. Tullingworth-Gordon
sometimes drank
in despite of plain American Rye.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-231.jpg" width="220" height="302"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>She left him with the structure
of a lifetime shattered; with
the love of twenty years nipped in
its late-bourgeoning bud. She left him
alone, and she left him with a deadly nepenthe at hand.</p>

<p>He fell upon those bottles, and, for once in his
quiet, steady, conservative life, he drank his fill. He
drank the soft, sub-acid claret; he drank the nutty
sherry; he drank the yellow Chartreuse and the ruddy
Curaçoa. He drank the fiery Cognac, and the smoky
Scotch whiskey. He drank and drank, and as his grief
rose higher and higher, high and more high he raised
the intoxicating flood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>At two o’clock of that night, a respectable butler
opened a side-door in the mansion of Mr. Tullingworth-Gordon,
and sallied forth to cool his brow in the midnight
air.</p>

<p>He was singing as they brought him back on a
shutter, in the early morning; but it was not wholly
with drunkenness, for delirium had hold of him. Down
to the south of the house were long stretches of marsh,
reaching into the Great South Bay, and there he had
wandered in his first intoxication. There he had stepped
over the edge of a little dyke that surrounded Mr. Tullingworth-Gordon’s
pike-pond&mdash;where all the pike died,
because the water was too salt for them&mdash;and there they
found him lying on his back, with one of the most
interesting cases of compound fracture in his right leg
that has yet been put on record, and with the flat stones
that topped the dyke lying over him.</p>

<p>They took him to his room over the stable, and put
him to bed, and sent for the doctor. The doctor came,
and set the leg. He also smelt of Mr. Bilson’s breath, and
gazed upon Mr. Bilson’s feverish countenance, and said:</p>

<p>“Hard drinker, eh? We’ll have trouble with him,
probably. Hasn’t he got anybody to look after him?”</p>

<p>This query found its way up to the manor-house of
the Tullingworth-Gordons. It came, in some way, to
the ears of Sophronia. Shortly after dinner-time she
appeared in the chamber of Bilson.</p>

<p>Bilson was “coming out of it.” He was conscious,
he was sore; he was heavy of heart and head. He
looked up, as he lay on his bed, and saw a comely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
middle-aged Englishwoman, sharp of feature, yet somehow
pleasant and comforting, standing by his bed.</p>

<p>“Sophronia!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she said; “the medical man said you
wasn’t to talk.”</p>

<p>“Sophronia&mdash;’tain’t you!”</p>

<p>“P’r’aps it ain’t,” said Sophronia, sourly; “p’r’aps
it’s a cow, or a ’orse or a goat, or anythin’ that is my
neighbor’s. But the best I know, it’s me, an’ I’ve come
to ’ave an eye on you.”</p>

<p>“Sophronia!” gasped the sufferer; “‘tain’t noways
proper.”</p>

<p>“‘T’s goin’ to be proper, Samuel Bilson. You
wait, an’ you’ll see what you’ll see.
’Ere ’e comes.”</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-233.jpg" width="250" height="234"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Bilson’s room was
reached by a ladder, coming
up through a hole in
the floor. Through this
hole came a peculiarly
shaped felt hat; then a
pale youthful face; then a
vest with many buttons.</p>

<p>“To ’ave and to ’old,”
said Sophronia. “‘Ere ’e is.”</p>

<p>The head came up, and
a long, thin body after it. Pale and
gaunt, swaying slightly backward and forward, like a
stiff cornstalk in a mild breeze, the Reverend Mr. Chizzy
stood before them and smiled vaguely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Chizzy was only twenty-four,
and he might have passed for nineteen; but he was so
high a churchman that the mould of several centuries
was on him. He was a priest without a cure; but, as
some of his irreverent friends expressed it, he was “in
training” for the Rectorship of St. Bede’s the Less, a
small church in the neighborhood, endowed by Mr.
Tullingworth-Gordon and disapproved of by his Bishop,
who had not yet appointed a clergyman. The Bishop
had been heard to say that he had not yet made up his
mind whether St. Bede’s the Less was a church or some
new kind of theatre. Nevertheless, Mr. Chizzy was on
hand, living under the wing of the Tullingworth-Gordons,
and trying to make the good Church-of-England
people of the parish believe that they needed him and
his candles and his choir-boys.</p>

<p>Behind Mr. Chizzy came two limp little girls, hangers-on
of the Tullingworth-Gordon household by grace
of Mrs. Tullingworth-Gordon’s charity. In New England
they would have been called “chore-girls.” The Tullingworth-Gordons
called them “scullery maids.”</p>

<p>Bilson half rose on his elbow in astonishment, alarm
and indignation.</p>

<p>“Sophronia ’Uckins,” he demanded, “what do
this ’ere mean? I ain’t a-dyin’, and I ain’t got no need
of a clergyman, thank ’eaven. And no more this ain’t
a scullery, Mrs. ’Uckins.”</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-235.jpg" width="220" height="262"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“This,” said Sophronia, pointing at the clergyman
as though he were a wax-figure in a show, “this is
to wed you and me, Samuel Bilson, and <i>them</i>” (she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
indicated the scullery maids,) “them
witnesses it.”</p>

<p>“Witnesses <i>wot</i>?” Mr. Bilson
inquired, in a yell.</p>

<p>“Witnesses our marriage,
Samuel Bilson. Nuss you I
can not, both bein’ single, and
nussed you must and shall be.
Now set up and be marri’d quiet.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bilson’s physical condition
forbade him to leap from the bed;
but his voice leaped to the rafters
above him.</p>

<p>“Marri’d!” he shouted: “I’ll die fust!”</p>

<p>“Die you will,” said Sophronia, calmly but sternly,
“if married you ain’t, and that soon.”</p>

<p>“Sophronia!” Bilson’s voice was hollow and deeply
reproachful; “you ’ave throwed me over.”</p>

<p>“I ’ave,” she assented.</p>

<p>“And ’ere I am.”</p>

<p>“And there you are.”</p>

<p>“Sophronia, you ’ave not treated me right.”</p>

<p>“I ’ave not, Samuel Bilson,” Miss Huckins cheerfully
assented; “I might ’ave known as you was not fit
to take care of yourself. But I mean to do my dooty
now, so will you ’ave the kindness to button your clo’es
at the neck, and sit up?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bilson mechanically fastened the neck-band of
his night-shirt and raised himself to the sitting posture.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Huckins,” Mr. Chizzy interrupted, in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
uncertain way; “I didn’t understand&mdash;you did not tell
me&mdash;there does not appear to have been the usual preliminary
arrangement for this most sacred and solemn
ceremony.”</p>

<p>Sophronia turned on him with scorn in her voice
and bearing.</p>

<p>“Do I understand, sir, as you find yourself in a
’urry?”</p>

<p>“I am not in a hurry&mdash;oh, no. But&mdash;dear me,
you know, I can’t perform the ceremony under these
circumstances.”</p>

<p>Miss Huckins grew more profoundly scornful.</p>

<p>“Do you know any himpediment w’y we should
not be lawfully joined together in matrimony?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said the perturbed cleric, “he doesn’t
want you.”</p>

<p>“‘E doesn’t know what ’e wants,” returned Sophronia,
grimly; “if women waited for men to find out
w’en they wanted wives, there’d be more old maids than
there is. If you’ll be good enough to take your book
in your ’and, sir, I’ll see to ’im.”</p>

<p>Bilson made one last faint protest.</p>

<p>“‘Twouldn’t be right, Sophronia,” he wailed; “I
ain’t wot I was; I’m a wuthless and a busted wreck. I
can’t tie no woman to me for life. It ain’t doin’ justice
to neither.”</p>

<p>“If you’re what you say you are,” said Sophronia,
imperturbably, “and you know better than I do, you
should be glad to take wot you can get. If I’m suited,
don’t <i>you</i> complain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Huckins,” the young clergyman broke in,
feebly asserting himself, “this is utterly irregular.”</p>

<p>“I know it is,” said Sophronia; “and we’re a-waitin’
for you to set it straight.”</p>

<p>The two chore-girls giggled. A warm flush mounted
to Mr. Chizzy’s pale face. He hesitated a second; then
nervously opened his book, and began the service.
Sophronia stood by the bedside, clasping Bilson’s hand
in a grasp which no writhing could loosen.</p>

<p>“Dearly beloved,” Mr. Chizzy began, addressing
the two chore-girls; and with a trembling voice he hurried
on to the important question:</p>

<p>“Wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded
wife?&mdash;“</p>

<p>“N&mdash;yah!”</p>

<p>Bilson had begun to say “No;” but Sophronia’s
firm hand had tightened on his with so powerful a pressure
that his negative remonstrance ended in a positive
yell.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>really</i>,” broke in Mr. Chizzy; “I can not
proceed, M&mdash;M&mdash;Miss&mdash;ah, what’s your name?&mdash;I
positively can’t!”</p>

<p>“<i>Mrs. Bilson</i>,” returned the unmoved Sophronia.
“Are you intending for to part ’usband and wife at this
point, sir? Excuse me; but we’re a-waitin’ of your
convenience.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chizzy was a deep red in the face. His pallor
had given place to a flush quite as ghastly in its way.
The blood was waltzing in giddy circles through his
brain as he read on and on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>No church&mdash;no candles&mdash;no robes&mdash;no choiring
boys. Only this awful woman, stern as death, commanding
him and Bilson. Why had he yielded to her?
Why had he permitted himself to be dragged hither?
Why was he meekly doing her bidding? Mr. Chizzy
felt as though he were acting in some ghastly, nightmarish
dream.</p>

<p>“<i>Then shall the Minister say</i>: Who giveth this
Woman to be married to this Man?”</p>

<p>That roused Mr. Chizzy from his trance. It came
late; but it seemed to open a way out of the horribly
irregular business. He paused and tried to fix an uncertain
eye on Sophronia.</p>

<p>“Have you a Father or a Friend here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Jim!” said Sophronia, loudly.</p>

<p>“Ma’am?” came a voice from the lower story of
the stable.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-239.jpg" width="250" height="281"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“Say ‘I do.’”</p>

<p>“Ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Say ‘I do’&mdash;an’ say it directly!”</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;say?&mdash;what do you want, Miss Huckins?”</p>

<p>“<i>Jim!</i>” said Sophronia, sternly, “open your
mouth an’ say ‘I do’ out loud, or I come down there
immejit!”</p>
<p>“I do!” came from the floor below.</p>

<p>“‘Ere’s the ring,” said Sophronia, promptly; “‘I,
M., take thee, N.’&mdash;if you’ll ’ave the kindness to go on,
sir, we won’t detain you any longer than we can ’elp.
I’m give away, I believe; an’ I’ll take ’im, M<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Forasmuch as,” began the Reverend Mr. Chizzy, a
few minutes later, addressing the chore-girls, “Samuel
and Sophronia have consented together in holy wedlock&mdash;“</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly. Up through the opening
in the floor arose the head
of a youthful negro, perhaps
fourteen years of age.
Mr. Chizzy recognized him
as the stable-boy, a jockey
of some local fame.</p>

<p>“What you want me
to say I done do?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“Mrs.&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;Bilson!”
said Mr. Chizzy, with
a tremulous indignation in
his voice; “did this negro
infant act as your parent or
friend, just now?”</p>

<p>“‘E give me away,”
replied the unabashed bride.</p>

<p>Mr. Chizzy looked at her, at Bilson, at Jim, and at
the chore-girls. Then he opened his book again and
finished the ceremony.</p>

<p>The Tullingworth-Gordons were angry when they
heard of the marriage. They missed the two mainstays
of their domestic system. But&mdash;well, Bilson was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
growing old, and Sophronia was growing tyrannical.
Perhaps it was better as it was. And, after all, they had
always wanted a Lodge, and a Lodge-keeper, and the
old ice-house stood near the gate&mdash;a good two hundred
feet from the house.</p>

<p>It was nearly a year before Bilson could walk around
with comfort. Indeed, eighteen months later, he did
not care to do more than sit in the sun and question
Fate, while Mrs. Bilson tried to quiet a noisy baby within
the Lodge.</p>

<p>“‘Ere I am laid up, as I should be,” said Bilson;
“an there’s an active woman a-goin’ around with a
baby, and a-nussin’ of him. If things was as they
should be, in the course of nachur, we’d ’ave exchanged
jobs, we would.”</p>

<p class="pn1 mid">by H. C. Bunner, illustrations by C. J. Taylor;
publishers, Keppler &amp; Schwarzmann.
The experiences of Paul Brown and his wife,
who escape a tame, adventureless life, with a
view of having “things happen to them,”
and to this end leave a pleasant home to be
gone a year and a day, are just the reading
for a Summer’s afternoon, and there is still
enough of Summer in the air to make it enjoyable
to its fullest. How the Browns fell
in with a band of barn-storming professionals;
how they became tin peddlers; how
they took charge of a lone hotel, and how
they finally and gladly reached their trim
cottage, is told in these clever and amusing
pages, and will bring more than one hearty
laugh even from those unused to smile.</p>

<p class="pc4 elarge">“MADE IN FRANCE.”</p>

<p class="p1 mid">Under the title of “Made in France”
H. C. Bunner has gathered a number of
short stories, all founded on tales by De
Maupassant. Several have suffered so great
a sea change, however, that the original
writer, if he were alive, would not recognize
them. In these about all that Bunner has
borrowed from the brilliant Frenchman is
what he calls the “ethical situations.” Others
bear evident traces of their French origin.
Mr. Bunner explains the motive of his novel
scheme in these words:</p>

<p>“I have selected a few ethical situations from among
the brightest of Maupassant’s inventions, and have tried
to reproduce them, not as translations, but as English or
American stories based on a Frenchman’s inspiration, and
I have done this with the sole hope of making that inspiration
clear to people who will not or can not read
Maupassant in the original. If through the new climes,
the new times, the new changes, the new worlds, indeed,
into which I have moved his people and their adventures,
you catch a better glimpse of the best fancies of M. Guy
de Maupassant than you can get through the misleading
mechanism of a literal translation, I shall be glad, indeed.”</p>

<p class="mid">There is no question of his success, for
nine out of ten of his readers would find De
Maupassant less amusing than Bunner. The
volume is very cleverly illustrated by Taylor.</p>
